Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"A small pour, ebony dark, no real head. Intense, rich aroma, brownies and German chocolate cake; dark sweetness. The taste amplifies the smell with the addition of sublime Kentucky bourbon. Heavy body; dense, chewy residual sugar feel with a sublime whiskey heat. 
 
This beauty was generously provided by @azuelke (Adam) at a bottle share hosted by @GreenBayBA in Sheboygan, WI. There were many great beers sample, many beautiful and exquisite dark beers, but nothing quite like this legendary beer. If ever you have a chance to try this one, all I can say is don't pass it up. The beer lives up to its legendary status.

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Vintage 2022, served on tap at Toppling Goliath in a ""snulip"" glass. Opaque deep blackish brown in color, with garnet highlights and a wisp of tan head. Where to start? Notes of cocoa, molasses, licorice, cherry cola, and maple syrup. The bourbon/barrel was, surprisingly, quite understated. Full body, almost syrupy, with good carbonation and a chewy mouthfeel. This finishes cleanly, with hints of roasted malt, maple syrup, and molasses lingering on the finish. This was incredibly easy drinking and not at all boozy despite the high ABV, and it was so good that I wanted to lick the glass clean. World class all the way.",5

Mornin' Delight,"What's not to like about this beer? From the time I opened it, until I finished the last sip, the aroma in the room was that of maple and coffee! It was like a dessert being prepared before you and the scent lingering in trying to attract you. It's mouthwatering to an extent. This is one of those things in life that tastes just like it smells. ""Delight"" is exactly what it is! I am thankful they upped the limits this year, because it's hard to keep my hands off the bottles when I open the fridge. Cheers!",4.7
Mornin' Delight,"Appearance - The beer was black in appearance with a smooth body that showed little visible carbonation and a modest tan head. 
 
Smell - Pancakes were immediately brought to mind with notes of coffee and maples syrup in the nose. It was like breakfast for dinner. 
 
Taste - As with the nose, it was like breakfast for dinner. The maple syrup seemed to saturate the stout, permeating the body. The beer was not overly sweet, but was balanced by the coffee notes. It seemed as though the coffee was washing down the sweetness. Notes of semi-sweet chocolate same toward the back, but the overall profile of chocolate chip pancakes with maple syrup lingered.  
 
Mouthfeel - The body was thick, but not quite motor oil quality. This made the beer more drinkable than the average heavy stout. Carbonation was still very present.  
 
Overall - The beer was definitely hype worth. Unlike some other TG beers, it was relatively easy to obtain.",4.71

Mornin' Delight,"2022 Variant - bottle split 4 ways - pours a a rich black with a nice mocha foam into a tulip. Overpowering maple on the nose, and was a little worried that this was going to be too sweet for me, and too much of a dessert stout, but the taste was so well balanced - maple sweetness was well calmed by the roasty coffee and baker's chocolate flavor.  
 
While MD was easier to obtain this year from a volume perspective, this was not a cheap bottle to get to Pittsburgh haha - overall - well worth it and while some of the shine might have worn off this beer nationally given it's more readily available, it's still a world class pour.

Heady Topper,"I had a chance to visit the brewery and have Heady Topper on tap, and bring a few home for a more in depth tasting. 
 
Aside from knowing its fame, I knew little else. My first thoughts were it was not quite as hazy as I expected. Secondly, upon tasting I was surprised to find it reminded me more of a western IPA than an NEIPA. Not that its a bad thing, I'm just preferential to hazy beers with grapefruit that you cannot see into. Most of my experience is with NY based NEIPAs which do seem a bit different than Vermont. 
 
Smell - It seemed more floral than fruity. The alcohol content also shone through a bit. 
 
Taste - Wow. No IBU rating on can but this has to be 60+ but not so much as to be a distraction in the taste. The flavor really helps balance the bitterness. The pine and resin was strong, albeit weaker than some great west coast IPA's I have had. This was followed by a complex fruitiness that was beyond me to completely identify. No massive grapefruit or citrus flavor I could identify, maybe a complex mixture of blackberry and blood orange would be the most apt description. 
 
The aftertaste was ... dark, damp, and lasting. In a great way. To me the ten seconds after the drink was probably the best part of the beer. The stronger alcohol content was very warming while the flavor was ... dark, but also releasing more taste as the seconds ticked by. 
 
And I must say I loved the brewery. Beautiful and great staff. I literally stayed a 3 minute walk from it. My only concern was it was a touch small on the inside seating area, the food options were not strong and it closes at 6PM. Another downside (lol) was the number of very good breweries within 15 minutes, I only was able to make one trip here due to committing to other breweries and the early closing hour.",4.37
Heady Topper,"What? I never rated Heady Topper! Great 'tude. Greater Vt.  
My sister brings this to me from Vt.

A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,"My first sacrifice at Dark Lord Day 2023 (it's back baby!!!), this screenprinted batch 1 Triple Oak label--sporting those the Aussie stickers with pride--poured a mildly viscous clear reddish-copper with nary a head to speak of, though ringed by a bubbly tan chain. 
 
Intensely woody up front, it even leans a little pungent and catty right out of the bottle. However, it quickly transforms into an explodingly delectable maple tempered by a whiskey heat that both continue to expand on the exhale and with each subsequent sip. 
 
Though this definitely shows its age, it's quite the experience nevertheless. Still, I'm not sure anything can beat my nostalgia for the original cognac-only bomber, despite my Double Oak rating being the highest of all three.",4.35

A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,"This is a special one. I wanted to crack this while reading Brandon Sanderson's ""Tress Of The Emerald Sea"". So I did. 
 
Apppearance is dark brown, just a shade brighter than a cup of coffee. Definitely some translucence.  
 
Nose is just a cacophony of oak, bourbon, dark bread with plum jam, apple butter, caramel soaked raisins, and coconut. Wow. Simply exquisite. The nose is expressive, but not overbearing. Restrained. 
 
The taste follows the nose perfectly. Sweet, dark fruit, like plum, date and fig, combined with caramel and brown sugar, rich breadiness, oak, apple, cherry, baking spices. Everything works perfectly with each other.  
 
Mouthfeel is full bodied. Not thick or syrupy either. Not too cloying. A little bit of evaporation to counteract. Some tannins to dry. It fits well in this regard. It doesn't hang too heavy on the palate.  
 
Overall this is stellar brew. I can't think of many words to really capture how absolutely amazing this experience is. A product crafted by masters in thier field and it shines through brilliantly.",4.84

Review 1600! I've saved a truly legendary beer for this milestone review, the highest rated American Barleywine on BA and 13th highest rated overall. I just had the Double Oak version yesterday and it was damn good, so I have high hopes for this. Let's crack this beast open and see what it's all about 
 
Pours a cloudy dark brown with just a finger of tan head that quickly fades to a nothing and leaves no lacing, but with fantastic legs 
 
In the nose, it's also quite similar to Double Oak, though with some more barrel presence. I'm picking up on aromas of earthy bourbon, charred oak, molasses, burnt caramel, plum, black cherry, cognac, toasted coconut, sweet vanilla, old leather, light fig, and toffee 
 
The booze is more forward here, but it pushes such wonderful complexities in taste that it actually adds to the experience. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting cocoa powder, black cherry, cognac, toasted oak, sweet bourbon, honey, molasses, dark toast, fig, sweet vanilla, raisin, light toffee, and tobacco. The swallow brings notes of leather, smoky tobacco, charred oak, molasses, fig, black cherry, toasted coconut, port wine, plum, cacao nib, burnt caramel, brown sugar, and light walnut 
 
A full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a rich and silky beer. Finishes a tad sticky, but the boozy tingle dries it out over time 
 
This is incredible. The Double Oak version was great too, but this one edges it out. Definitely a beer I'll remember for years to come",4.6

Beer opens chocolate, fudge, and cinnamon sugar. Spicy and prickly. Vanilla and barrel in the middle. Oak, booze, and more molasses and fudge at the end. Sticky finish.

Another milestone review, number 1800! I figured since I have the highest rated RIS on BA just sitting around that it would be a perfect time to break it out. This is my first of any Dark Lord variant, and I think it’s a damn good place to start for the series. Let’s pop this legend open and see what it has to offer 
 
Pours almost completely pitch black with a finger of creamy tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing 
 
The roast is real in this one, but it’s wonderfully offset by the sweeter notes as well. I’m picking up on aromas of drip coffee, burnt caramel, dark toast, milk chocolate, tobacco, vanilla bean, molasses, toasted oak, fig, and light cinnamon 
 
It’s similar in taste, but with even more of a depth, making this one hell of a complex beer. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, vanilla bean, sweetened coffee, toasted oak, fig, maple syrup, burnt caramel, sweet bourbon, cinnamon, black cherry, and marshmallow. The swallow brings notes of milk chocolate, charred oak, maple syrup, burnt caramel, black cherry, fig, vanilla bean, allspice, sweet bourbon, marshmallow, dark toast, and tobacco 
 
A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer. Finishes mostly dry with just a touch of boozy heat

On the evening of March 10th, 2023, I had the pleasure of enjoying a batch 2 bottle thanks to the contrite generosity of a long lost friend, ultimately coming away enjoying it even more than b4.  
 
Here, an oaky funk pairs with an impressive array of stonefruits and pear accompanied by a beautiful bouquet of herbal accents, including a hint of spearmint, making for an absurdly unique yet ever delicate expression. Unlike b4, I do actually feel that I perceive the faintest hint of buckwheat here, which provides a satisfying comfort in a small but substantial way.

Look: Deep, dark brown, almost (but not quite) black. Thin chocolate colored head, but more than I expected for a four year old bottle. 
 
Smell: Maple and chocolate and immediately obvious, with noticeable bourbon as well. Little to no coffee. 
 
Taste: The strong maple sweetness and the bourbon are noticeable first. Some chocolate is there, but very little coffee except for some bitterness in the aftertaste. The lack of an overwhelming coffee taste works well here, as it lets the maple and bourbon shine but provides just enough bitterness to offset the maple sweetness. 
 
Feel: Silky and smooth with a moderate bite on the back end. The 11.3% ABV is more noticeable in the feel that the taste. Warmth and a mild sting from the alcohol are both present, but not in overwhelming amounts. 
 
Overall: this is a world-class beer for good reasons. This is my very last bottle, so unless Founders re-releases it in the future I'll just say CBS will forever be one of the absolute best barrel aged stouts I have ever had the pleasure of sampling.",4.63

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"2016 Vintage - Drank 02/24/21 
 
Smell -pleasant with notes of tobacco and chocolate 
 
Taste - The tobacco over powers this one in the beginning. And then as it warms, the peppers take over. Very unique taste, and I think it’s the brandy barrel influence. 
 
Feel - thin, and I expected more 
 
Overall - for being the #4 overall beer on BA, I expected more, much more. The feel was thin, and notes of pepper overpowered this. Yet it was not completely unenjoyable, just not even close to the 4th best beer in the world. Regardless, glad I gut to try it as it’s always nice to see what the hype is about. This one just didn’t live up to it",4.15

Abner,"Such a well balanced beer. Hill Farmstead doesn't go crazy with one flavor profile and that is embodied here. While labeled a NE IPA, is more caramel colored than hazy and tastes blend west coast and east coast styles, similar to Focal Banger. Definitely hoppy at the start but mellows with a malty, oaty finish. Partly hoppy and partly rustic, Abner is a expertly minimalist IPA. They do all the little things right.",4.59

Abner,,4.34
Abner,Definitely a double. The alcohol flavor is produced more so than other hill farmstead beers. However the beer is truly a HF beer with the deep caramel hue and succinct crisp hoppiness that is so refined. Amazing beer but I prefer a lower alcohol beer.,4.61
Abner,"6 weeks old. Can to wine glass. 
 
Look: Pours a golden-brownish orange with a pillowy white head that dissipates rather quickly leaving a good amount of lacing. Floaters all over the place. 
 
Smell: Piney, resiny, somehow woody and slightly smoky. Also sweeter notes of melon and gummy bears. 
 
Taste: Less intense, more balanced, but all the notes which can be smelled can also be tasted. Resiny body with notes of sweet melon and burnt caramel, and something woody and smoky popping up here and there. Medium sweetness followed by an intensely bitter finish. 
 
Feel: Clean and full at the same time. Medium carbonation. Quite crushable. 
 
Overall: Very complex west coast style IIPA that combines a typical piney and woody body with different kinds of sweetness. Some unexpected notes (smoke, gummy bears) are also in the mix, but everything fits in seamlessly. I‘d definitely locate this one somewhere close to Heady Topper and Pliny the Elder. Great beer that once again demonstrates the versatility of Hill Farmstead brewing high quality stuff from different styles.",4.69

Well damn, my first Hill Farmstead beer and it’s the 35th highest rated beer on BA! I know they’re more known for their Saisons, but I’m very happy to try this 
 
Pours a hazy orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves nice lacing 
 
For the style, this isn’t super juicy in the nose. I’m picking up on aromas of the overripe melon, lemon zest, bready malt, light caramel, peppery hops, fresh grass, and grapefruit rind 
 
It’s a little more aggressive in taste but still feels more rustic than juicy and fruity. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting lemon zest, crackery malt, tangerine, overripe melon, weedy hops, and light caramel. The swallow brings notes of grapefruit zest, orange juice, bready malt, peppery hops, fresh grass, and light tangerine 
 
A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a zesty yet creamy beer. Finishes mostly dry and very balanced 
 
Holy shit, this is a great beer. Super unique for the style and so drinkable especially for the abv. I need more",4.48

Blessed,"Pours squid ink black and settles in the glass like a black velvet cloak, stopping all light, sitting under a sudsy dark tan head that dissipates quickly, as expected with a beer of this gravity. Absolutely gorgeous imperial stout. 
 
I don’t know if the nose of a beer can be decadent, but this beer’s nose is, with rich cocoa and vanilla notes up front, some dark cherries, and a sledgehammer of oak and barrel notes. 
 
The taste is led by the vanilla and cocoa notes, and they are rich and chewy, moving into the dark cherry flavors to cut the sweetness a bit, and then finishing with the oak and a welcome boozy warming from the three bourbon barrels featured in this beer. 
 
The mouthfeel is as rich and decadent as a gooey bourbon soaked brownie sitting in a dip of vanilla ice cream. I can’t imagine a more perfect rendering of a BA imperial stout.",4.85
Blessed,"If Woodford Reserve, Willet and Heavenly Hill were to get together and make a beery baby, they would be so blessed to have this stout. Slumbering away for extended aging these three barrels give Anchorage Brewing a love child that can compete with the best. 
 
Jet black and pouring like inky tar, Blessed pours with a luscious, ominous and velvety pour. While shy on froth the overwhelming scent of molasses, chocolate, whisky, oak, coconut and cream align with stronger scents of coffee and campfire. Once on the tongue, the immense sweetness of molasses, brown sugar and fudge carry and nearly brownie-batter taste with those sweeter bourbon barrels playing a maple and coconut sweetness. 
 
As the sweeter flavors swirl on the tastebuds, notions of mound and almond joy pop off of the middle palate while the malts remain juicy and plush. Trailing into a smooth espresso, cappuccino character, the late taste brings out all of those coconut, toasted oak, vanilla, cherry and savory smoke to have the session trending warm, sultry and savory set of pleasantries. 
 
Full bodied, pillowy and fortified with nearly port-like proportions, the stout is simply magical. It pushes the boundaries in what is a fully malted imperial stout before pushing into the pastry realm. The warmth of whisky is soothed with caramel malts, vanilla and coconut and balances the sheer malts with utter ease.",4.83

Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,"It's wonderful to pour the contents of two twelve ounce bottles into a clear glass liter mug and not be overwhelmed by stark white foam. Instead, there's a modest off-white head atop a bright and dark caramel colored brew. For all its color, there remains a translucent quality as well. In short, a fine looking beer. Caramel, malt and spices, which seem to include allspice, coriander and nutmeg provide the aroma. Thankfully, the malt and maybe an assist from molasses is the dominant taste, with the spices augmenting rather than dominating the flavor. Overall, this is malty and sweet, with a good caramel reference. While that may not be great press, it's so much better than the now overload of winter/holiday/Christmas ales that merely overly spice a not so good brew. The glass lacing, whilst not spectacular, does bear witness to each serving. The body may not be outstanding as a a barley malt based brew, but it far surpasses most beers that omit, or drastically reduce it. It's claim is that it's rich and sweet and it is, but not too much in either way.",4.22

Carbonation has the bottle overflowing once I crack the lid. Pours two fingers of dense tan head into my snifter. Retention is very nice, but does eventually fade. Lacing is subpar. Body is a deep reddish brown. Looks decent. 
 
Nose has plenty of sweetness, with notes of fig and plum. Tart esters quickly appear and add a much needed balance, reminiscent of cherries. No clove. Smells massive, as you’d expect. A little on the sweet side for me, but I can dig it. 
 
Flavor blasts you with a massive dose of stone fruit, has a sweet impression, but drinks very clean. Maybe a touch of tart cherries in the background. Overall it’s still not my go-to style, but it’s impressive, and certainly something I would not turn down. 
 
The carbonation is medium by the time I go looking for it, don’t recall it being insanely high to begin with. Sweetness is apparent, but pretty modest compared to what it could be; well attenuated. Bitterness is low and only really shows up briefly in the finish with the tart fruit. Has some body, but comes through surprisingly light, given the modest sugar and carbonation. Overall the mouthfeel stays reasonable, and it brings a somewhat smooth feel that supports the beer nicely.

Initial taste before swallowing is skunky with a mellow sweet yeasty background. After swallowing I get a big hit of breadiness I quite like, which dwindles into the aftertaste but remains. Appearing somewhere in the middle is a hop presence you'd expect from a lager, not strong, herby, being slightly dry and olive green, and a little spicy/peppery and floral. Through the entire process exists that skunkiness and it just isn't pleasant. It's more bitter than I would expect, but not enough to slow down my process. 
 
Mouthfeel is actually impressive, definitely has enough body to it to feel substantial. I don't think I'd say creamy but there's a little richness, seems as though it glides. 
 
Overall It's about where I'd expect, solid but not great. I must say I was surprised how skinny it was, which really subtracted from the experience, but the other flavors present were nice. The mouthfeel was pleasant and made it easy to drink where the flavor put me off a little, nice average beer I'd say. 
 
Not likely to buy again but I could be convinced if it's cheap, don't remember how much I paid for it.",3.12
Stella Artois,Don't be fooled by its look or it's smell (nothing extraordinary there). The canned version of this beer is remarkably smooth without being tasteless. It pairs great with a meal. In my opinion it's a solid beer for its price.,3.91

Stella Artois,"Presentation: 12 ounce bottle poured into a beer stein.  
 
Look: light golden color. Moderate carbonation. Frothy head that lingers longer than expected.  
 
Smell: primarily smells grassy and flowery. Moderate hops aroma. Minor fruity aroma.  
 
Taste: it has a well balanced taste with a variety of flavors. It tastes hoppy, grassy, flowery, and even a bit Smokey.  
 
Feel: smooth velvety mouthfeel.  
 
Overall this a good beer. Very easy to drink but also flavorful. Very refreshing on an hot day. Apparently it’s brewed in Saint Louis and not in Belgium now which is sort of disappointing. I would recommend this beer to anyone who’s looking for a flavorful lager without any frills.

Stella Artois,"Poured from a 25oz can into my Guinness glass.  
 
Looks golden, slightly golden-brown, not too yellow. Thick fluffy white head that stayed for a while.  
 
Smelled that slightly skunky smell that I get on pretty much all lagers. Smell got worse with every sip as it warmed, eventually getting urine-y. : ( 
 
Tastes better than it smells. Smooth and bready, no real top-end crispness but very little bitterness. Full in the middle range.  
 
Feels smooth too. Not overly carbonated.  
 
Waaaay better than standard American lagers. I’d happily drink it if it were offered. Don’t need to go out of my way for it, though.",3.24
Stella Artois,"Pours a very pretty crystal clear brass color, nice very white cohesive head that settles into some clumpy white islands, some of which try to cling to the glass in a show of minor lacing. Swirling the glass around gives a nice visual as the carb is visible and replenishes the head. 
 
Nose is a mix of white bread, cracker, wafer like, light macro lager skunkiness, and very light floral leaning hops, I would stop short of saying floral though. 
 
The taste is surprisingly refreshing, while cold especially, has a generic very light maltiness that carries a very minor touch of sweet; reminds me of wonder bread but less doughy; some definite hop presence, lightly peppery but they are definitely outshined by the malt. The malty sweet slowly becomes more powerful as this beer warms. 
 
Light body, slightly effervescent, some light sweetness coats the tongue but it finishes surprisingly dry with a low-moderate bitterness; has a nice snappy finish to me. As this beer warms it becomes sweeter and has more of a macro lager taste/feel to it. 
 
I'm enjoying this beer a lot more than I thought I would have, compared to other mass produced euro lager it actually isn't half bad. Worth giving a shot, in my opinion.",3.48

Black Chocolate Stout,Excellent Stout!,4.75
Black Chocolate Stout,"Allowed to acclimate to room temperature for 18 minutes and poured into a snifter. 
 
Pours an incredibly dark brown with equally dark brown hints around the edges, and a 1.5 finger dark tan head. 
 
Initial aroma is a hint of black licorice, followed by Dutch processed cocoa powder, I think there's some raisin in there. I might get a tiny hint of smoke and oak, but I might be hallucinating. 
 
Initial taste is bold and powerful, perhaps a small hint of licorice but otherwise just a big and slightly overwhelming experience to take a large sip. It's quickly followed by bitter Dutch cocoa taste across the middle, back, and sides of the tongue in the middle and aftertaste. I get some bitterness not from the chocolate but from the beer itself as well. Tasting it again after, I realize that in the initial taste it's the alcohol I'm tasting, followed by the licorice, then the cocoa and bitterness. As I get through it I taste a little raspberry, but only in the aftertaste, and only when sipping very small amounts, it's a much welcomed note with the chocolate. Additionally, as I get towards the end the alcohol becomes more noticable in both aroma and taste. At the end I thought the alcohol tasted similar to that of vodka burn and made me think of hass avocado skin and the color olive drab. I know that doesn't make sense, sorry. 
 
The mouthfeel is nice, not exactly velvet smooth but it is definitely smooth. It glides over the tongue easily. Oily and slick, in a good way, if that makes sense. 
 
This is something I could imagine myself sipping slowly with my legs crossed, wearing a nice jacket and having a discussion with someone in a nice living room. 
 
May buy again but not terribly likely, overall a good beer that I enjoyed but did not adore and I think I'm satisfied with drinking once.",3.85
Black Chocolate Stout,"This is a yearly purchase for me, and it’s been interesting to note the slight variation with each release.  
As always, this is a great looking stout. Black with some brown edging, tan head with decent retention. Getting some char, molasses, and fig in the aroma, along with a dark chocolate backbone. The taste surprised me, however. I can still remember the utter shock I had many, many years ago when I found out that this beer DOES NOT ACTUALLY CONTAIN CHOCOLATE. It was an eye-opening experience to see what could be accomplished through malt selection and high-level brewing technique. This year’s release, however, has a super roasty, almost burnt, quality. The chocolate also seems much more like a super dark, bitter (85% cacao) version, rather than the smoother, fudgier flavor I’m used to. It’s alright on the way down, but the finish & aftertaste are harsh. A bit of a letdown compared to prior years, but still decent.",3.97

Black Chocolate Stout,"I've been enjoying BBCS for over 20 years, presented and promoted it for over a decade, offered it in numerous beer tasting events on tap, fresh and in vintage bottles. But this is my 1st review here. It's changed over the years, as will this one if stored properly. 
New brown swirly label I don't care for - the classy image of the white on black is missing. 
The pour results in a tall, dark tan head of sticky foam with good persistence and specks of lace over a jet black liquid.  
The aroma is big and sweet but not bold or overwhelming. Strong treacle and molasses notes mix with bakers chocolate dripped over warm oatmeal, with a splash of tequila. 
The flavor is busy - sharp black grain and long boil hop bitterness stab the tongue up front right along with the caramel malt sweetness that adds depth and complexity. Softer hints of drunken cherries and berries, figs and rye bread all blend with the charred grain and sweet toffee stoutness. 
Body is BIG and alcohol doesn't hide well even in the deep, warm stout flavors. 
The finish is long and bitter, grassy hops, wet leather and black coffee. 
Still a winner but in a boring new package/label.",4.15

Bottled On: Winter 2019 
Consumed on: 26 Dec, 2022 
Glass: Tulip Snifter 
ABV: 10% 
Serving Temp: room temp 
 
 
Look:  
Black with a 23-finger high creamy dark tan to light brown head. The head dissipates slowly, leaving very good lacing. 
 
Smell:  
Dark roasted malts with a touch of char. Rich semisweet dark chocolate mixed with some milk chocolate notes. A touch of vanilla. 
 
Taste:  
All the aromas are here and dialed up a notch. A black licorice or anise note joins the party about mid-sip. This is followed by light smokey notes and a light touch of char and ash. Some molasses even sneaks in and perhaps a hint of a dark fruit. A mild bitterness then arrives and helps to change the chocolate to a bittersweet variety. The sip finishes lightly bitter, a tad dry, malty, and lighltly chocolatey. 
 
Feel:  
Creamy, silky and viscous. Warmth from the alcohol can be felt. The body is medium. 
 
Overall:  
A very nice Russian Imperial Stout. Great aromas. Great flavors. Enjoyable and easy to drink. I don't detect much bitterness, which must be from the 3 years that I had this beer in the cellar.",4.29

Nelson,"So, what do we have here? A once legendary beer that has (allegedly) been bastardized beyond recognition. This was a long time want for me before I knew the whole story of it, and ultimately ended up forgetting about it. However, when I saw it on Tavour I figured it was at least worth a shot. Let's crack it open and see if it's really as bad as some say 
 
Pours a hazy pale yellow with 3 fingers of soapy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves minimal lacing 
 
The nose is quite vibrant here, I'm not really understanding the complaints yet. I'm picking up on aromas of red grapefruit, gooseberry, grassy hops, rye bread, white pepper, orange zest, light papaya, and white grape 
 
It's a bit less balanced in taste for sure, focusing more on the bitterness, but it's still damn good. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting gooseberry, earthy hops, lemon zest, rye bread, grass, overripe cantaloupe, and light weed. The swallow brings notes of rye bread, earthy hops, black pepper, lemon zest, papaya, pithy grapefruit, light papaya, and dank weed 
 
A light medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a snappy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a firm bitterness to keep things refreshing 
 
Maybe drinking this through the lens of not having had the original invalidates my opinion, but I don't really care. This isn't perfect, but a damn good IPA as is",4.16
Nelson,,4.18
Nelson,"I first rated Alpine's Nelson in 2015, and gave it a 4.41 average rating. It's been the third highest of all the IPAs I've rated over the years, not quite 200. 
 
In those early years (2014-2015), I had Nelson on tap a few times. It was uncommon in Seattle, but always a treat. 
 
Well, now I've had Nelson in cans, and I guess it's the ""new Nelson"". I've read about some of the behind the scenes stuff on who's made it. I don't know the whole story, but I do know that the beer I just had in a six pack is nothing too special. It's nowhere near what I remember of the once ethereal beer. So I deleted my old rating, as it no longer applies. This is a new rating/review, as of July 2023. 
 
Nelson looks gorgeous, big fluffy white head, and golden color. The smell is piney. It's a little out of the ordinary for a 2023 beer, as it's not a citrus bomb (grapefruit), like Pliny, and it's also a long way from the fruity hazy taste profiles of NE IPAs. It's kind of old school, which I like. However, the rye character has pretty much gone missing, and the Nelson Sauvin hop profile isn't nearly as good as I remembered. Fortunately, it's still got a solid bitterness to it. 
 
I guess I'm just pining for the OG.",3.79

Nelson,"Found this on Friday while returning from some hiking and stopped at Total Wine on the way back to the Old Line State. This is obviously a beer that needs no introduction and I wasn't sure if it was available on the east coast. Opaque, ultra yellow body like a latter day hazy IPA but the nose is more familiar citrus and grapefruit lending towards pine but still fruity.  
 
The flavor is unique; very dry at the outset, it seems pretty subtle but continues to develop and deliver throughout the aftertaste. High carbonation also hides flavor in the early stages before revealing grapeskin, bread, bubble gum, melon, and finally, the promised rye. Really nice, luxurious mouthfeel is a highlight as well. I did not love the start, but this one grew on me.",4.23

T: rye is more prominent in flavor adding some spiciness and robustness; juicy pineapple, tangerine, mango, and nectarine with bitter pine on the finish 
F: fuller body, ample carbonation, bittersweet finish with pine and citrus zest lingering with the spicy rye; very dry finish

Hazy orange with notes of citrus, white grape, lemon, bubblegum, bread crust, and weed, on both the nose and taste. Low to medium bitterness with a medium mouthfeel and carb. A textbook, well-executed Nelson profile. White grape aftertaste. Very good. Each category is pushing 4.5 for me, so I give this a 4.5 overall.",4.3

F: Gently fizzy then smooth & glassy w a medium body and a residually brisk and bright citrusy med-long finish that is slightly drying.

Nelson,"This is a genuinely good India Pale Ale, but it may not be for everyone. First of all, it's hazy, but it's not an NEIPA. Secondly, it's dry and bitter, which many of us love, but if you're looking for a well-balanced beer in terms of hops vs. malts, this is NOT for you!  
 
Nelson is bitter, and I think it's made with rye which accentuates hops, but it's also not hard to drink and is quite ""zesty"" in terms of hops, meaning it's less piney and more fruit forward (citrus, but with layers of character, and that's cool because this is a single hop IPA obviously as the name implies). I like this beer, a lot. It's usually expensive, it may not be canned by Alpine, blah, blah, blah...it's great and if you like IPAs, it's a must-try beer.",4.39
Nelson,"Can with unreadable date. GL Tulip. 
 
A: pours a turbid hazy yellow with three fingers of meringue-like frothy white head. No visible carbonation; it’s too hazy. 
 
S: from a foot away I can smell the sweet, tropical fruitiness. Like papaya and gooseberries in syrup. 
 
T: on first arrival, hop burn; tangy, tart, tropical, citric, floral, ending on a grapefruit rind light bitterness. There is a lingering bitterness that I actually find unpleasant. I think it’s the rye. I love rye whiskey, but I can’t think of a single rye beer I’ve liked - including this one. The hop burn and sweetness on the arrival make it unpleasant, as does the weird rye finish. 
 
M: lighter side of medium, pillow-soft.  
 
O: I saw this on the shelf ten years ago, and wanted to buy it but passed it up. I didn’t start seeing it here again until a year ago, and that’s post AB acquisition. I wasn’t willing to get a six, but I saw a single today and wasn’t going to miss it again. When this beer came out, ten years ago, it was revolutionary. Not so much today. Its beautiful to look at and smell, and is still a great example of the hazy IPA style, but strikes me as too fruity and unpleasant on the finish. At least it’s got a good name.",4.04

Overall: Another iconic, old school IPA. Pours a clear amber color producing a nice fluffy white head with good retention. The Cascade and Cluster Hops provide citrus aromas of grapefruit and oranges that distinguish the nose. You also get some toasty bread hints from the lightly roasted malts. Tastes include citrus notes combined with the sweet malt that you would expect from a beer of amber color.

Hold On To Sunshine,"Poured from 16oz can into pint glass in February 2023, that I purchased at their brewery in Charlton, MA. There is a date of Winter 2023 on the bottom of the can, and I drank this about 1 month after I purchased it.  
 
Appearance: Very dark black with 1-finger head. The head was dark brown, and disappeared after a minute. It left only a little lacing on the glass, and no head remained after a minute. 
 
Smell: Strong mix of aromas filled the room as soon as the can was opened. Roasted coffee, caramel, and chocolate aromas. Not much hop style citrus or pine aromas. 
 
Taste: There is taste of coffee, chocolate, and licorice. Also, some vanilla, peanut butter, and roasted malt flavors. They are more balanced than I expected from the aroma. Flavors are very bold. There is a strong alcohol presence that matches 7.6% advertised. A sweet chocolate, and vanilla aftertaste with edge of coffee, that is really enjoyable. 
 
Mouth-feel: Very thick, but with an extremely smooth and creamy body. 
 
This is a very good Porter, and one of the best Porters I have ever drank. It has a variety of flavors that adds a nice complexity to the beer. The balance of flavors is outstanding. The flavors of coffee and roasted malt nicely balance the bitter coffee with the sweet chocolate and caramel flavors. This is even better than the Tree House Cartharsis Porter, which is very good.

Abraxas,"Pours an opaque, pitch-black coloration with a small, fizzy head. Smells of roasted, caramel malt and strong milk chocolate and cinnamon aromas, with hints of vanilla coming through as well. Taste follows the nose, with a poor balance of roasted, caramel malt and strong chocolate and cinnamon notes, with the cinnamon standing out particularly, as well as some vanilla and just the merest hint of chilis. Finishes bittersweet, with a medium sweetness, light bitterness and some cinnamon and chocolate lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and carbonation. 
 
BA Abraxas has got to be the most overrated stout that I have ever tasted and, perhaps unsurprisingly, the same goes for the base version which suffers from exactly the same poor balance that I already disliked for the barrel-aged version. It's basically a total cinnamon bomb, the cinnamon being WAY too overdone here and pretty much drowning out everything else except the chocolate, which only underlines the sweetness of the cinnamon. There's hints of vanilla as well, but next to no chili heat coming through, which this would have desperately needed to balance out that sweetness. At least the roasted malts and a light bitterness in the finish prevent this from becoming quite too cloyingly sweet, but I have had plenty of much better Mexican Imperial Stouts and the hype that surrounds this beer absolutely mystifies me. I will say that the body and mouthfeel are indeed very nice here, rich and velvety, while the chilis seem to come out just a little bit more as this warms. Also, the ABV is very well-hidden, this drinking surprisingly smooth and mellow. This is by no means a bad beer, just feels more like a Pastry Stout than a Mexican Stout to me.",3.94
Abraxas,"2022 vintage. Cacao and a hint of chili on the nose. Taking a first sip, the cacao really pops. A light chili and cinnamon aftertaste follows. The chili isn't spicy, but it's flavorful. 
 
This is a fantastic imperial stout. At first, I thought this might be a little too sweet, but as I drink more, it's really not. The sweetness does a great job of balancing out the bitterness of the baker's chocolate as well as the cinnamon and I can see why they did it. I might have dialed it back just a hair, but that's a nitpick. 
 
FULL bodied. Nice and thick, like an imperial stout should be. Almost chewy. As the beer gets warmer, the cinnamon gets more noticeable. 
 
Long after a sip, vanilla takes center stage as it lingers on the tongue with the cacao, chili and cinnamon still noticeable in the background. Wonderful. 
 
Overall, this is one of the very best imperial stouts I've had. Excellent job. I will buy a few more of these and see how they age, assuming I can keep them around for a few years without drinking them first.",4.53
Abraxas,"Truly an excellent beer! 
 
Bought a bomber of this beer at the brewery this past March. I decided to have it for Father’s Day! 
 
Poured into a tulip glass. Rich, oily dark brown color with a brown head and excellent curtain lacing. Needed to let it warm for the nose to open a bit. Smell of dark chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla and chili pepper. Follows to the taste. Initially the flavors of fresh stone fruit contributed. This transitioned to stronger chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla. The chili also becomes stronger as it warms. Apricot and cream, seriously. Pleasant booze and malt background. Flavors are so nicely woven together. Luxuriant smooth feel. I would love to try the barrel aged version sometime. A great Father’s Day treat!",4.54
Abraxas,"Deep copper with a 1/2"" tan head, which slowly fades. Minimal lacing. 
 
Aroma of cinnamon, chocolate, hot pepper, vanilla, caramelly as it warms.

Full body, light carbonation. Thick & oily finish. 
 
Bottled 10/23/17. As expected with a 5 year old high ABV stout, it has little head & minimal lacing. Apart from that, this is a very good Imp Stout.",4.45

Stickee Monkee,"2014 bottle.

The taste is semisweet caramel, bourbon and brown sugar with lingering tobacco, oak and leather on the finish. Minimal bitterness.

Stickee Monkee,"Rare 2015 vintage draught pour at Apex Bar in Portland OR. 
Presented flat. No foam at all. Deep brown, borders on black. 
Smells great. Dark stone fruits and that famiiar Quad on the nose. 
Taste is toes on the line too sweet, but it doesn’t become cloying or teeth-achingly so. I think maybe because it’s 7 years old, some if the nuances intended have been lost. But the dark brown sugar, stewed plums and oak barrel all make appearances throughout the chew. 
Feel is very dense, quite viscous, no carbonation.

A bit of smoke on the opening of the bottle. Dark brown pouring with a 2 finger tan head, with a fairly aggressive pour. The retention is decent, and there's some lacing on the glass.  
The aroma is strong with dark fruit - I get a lot of plum and raisin in the nose.  
Taste - Tons of plum and raisin hit up front. There's a hint of caramel and toffee on the back. I also get a creamy flavor mixing in, almost a lactose flavor. This last thing surprised me, probably not getting it right.  
The body is very thick and full. Smooth, and very little alcohol burn.  
I love this beer, and so glad I bought it.",4.44
Stickee Monkee,"The beer is mahogany, dark brown color. The beer fizz with sound while pouring, but leaves a thin layer of foam only, which disappears very quickly. The beer smells dark, smoky, brown sugar, coffee, leather, molasses and whiskey barrel oaky. The wooden, oaky barrel aroma is distinct, it’s clearly a barrel-aged strong ale. 
 
The beer is full bodied, velvety, latte creamy, with a bit of fizz tickling on tongue. The beer is moderate sweet (it’s 2016 bottle? 6 years later it’s still not dry?), with a bold palate, with a bit sour (tart cherry), light bitter and subtle salty at back. The taste is great, renders the beer bold, but the flavor is on the stout side than a quad (which should be drier?) to me. The malty backbone is strong, and there’s dark sugar (Turbinado brown sugar from Mexico) added which is not that fruity but with molasses and toffee candy hints. When I sip, I sense some dark chocolate, roasted chestnut nutty, alcohol burn, salted toffee candy, leather and tobacco earthiness, whiskey filled chocolate bottle, dried fig and raisin aromas. The beer taste bold, very malty and dark sugar characters, but it’s not ester heavy nor fruity. My feeling of this beer is a serious gentleman who will not wink or smile, but just sitting still and sipping cigar. This is a malty beverage, really malty, I think it may need another 5 years of aging to became more mellow. I expect more layers in this beer, but currently it’s just a bit too sweet (malty) to enjoy.",4.22

All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Charlton, MA 
2022 
Served in a Tree House Brewing Company tulip 
 
The beer poured a syrupy and rather intense looking pitch black hue. An inch-tall, tight and creamy, mocha colored crown topped the liquid and slowly fell to a thick, lasting collar. Streaks and drops of lacing stuck all along the sides of the glass. 
 
The aroma was decent initially and definitely improved with time. Moderately roasty with day-old coffee notes. Bit of acrid character and perhaps some raw cocoa too. As the beer sat, sweet, creamy lactose notes appeared. Good dose of vanilla as well. Chocolate syrup was also noticeable. The sweetness and the chocolate character intensified as the beer sat. 
 
The flavor profile was also solid but perhaps not as smooth as the nose. Malty and robust up front. Roasted malts were most apparent. Moderate caramel malt presence too. Cold coffee was also noticeable. Subtle lactose and vanilla notes were detectable in the center. Slightly sweet. More roastiness on the back end and the finish. Moderate amount of bitterness. Some alcohol warmth came through as well. 
 
Nice creamy, smooth mouthfeel. Medium bodied for the style. Slightly syrupy. The liquid contained a finer beaded, somewhat prickly effervescent that turned fluffy on the palate. 
 
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be is an enjoyable beer, though not as impressive as its ratings might suggest. Both the flavor profile and the mouthfeel came across as a bit flat.

Traquair Jacobite,"Been a damn minute since I have had this beer, maybe a decade to be honest. One of those beers I tried in the very beginning of getting into craft beer. Excited to see what I think with some experience now. 
 
A- Very dark brown cola body when poured from the stubby 500ml bottle into a becher glass. A nice foamy cap up to a finger with a very light tan off white hue. Small sheets of thin lacing. 
 
S- Rich and sweet dark, dried fruits are bright and intense with raisin, prune and especially plum coming to mind. Definitely picking up a touch of herbal coriander as well as a hint of orange peel. Molasses, brown sugar, toffee, nuttiness, pear, caramel, berry jam and a hint of smoke. 
 
T- Just ground up some coriander the other day and it is not exactly strong but certainly a featured, prominent flavor atop the rich dark grains and the dried dark fruits from the ferment. The malt profile is diverse with toasty, nutty, bready, grainy, slight cocoa, light roast, caramel, molasses and a touch of smoky notes. Plums are bright and are joined by notes of raisin and prune. Pear comes to mind again. 
 
MF- Medium bodied overall with a foamy and slightly creamy texture. The carbonation is at a moderate level and it has a smooth, soft feel to it. Ends with a spice bitterness lingering. 
 
Coriander, a ton of dark bright fruits and a great malt profile. Brings me back a long ways and still a classic that really is quite unique.",4.4

Traquair Jacobite,"Review 1514 
 
I had no idea that I did not review this beer. I have drunk this beer several years ago do not remember much about it. The beer is 46 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour of the beer created a light tan one-finger head. The head is creamy and foamy with excellent retention. The slow dissipation on the glass left a lot of lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is SRM 24, dark brown with ruby red hues. This beer is opaque. Overall this beer is above average for this style.  
 
The aromas in the beer are caramel, roasted malts, toffee, malty sweetness, subtle peat, a touch of smoke, a smidge of Maillard, floral, oranges, and some earthiness.  
 
The flavors in the beer start with a light caramel then segway into peat with oranges and earthiness. Next, I taste some Maillard, floral, toffee dried raisins, molasses, and herbal.  
 
The mouthfeel is coating and warming.  
 
The body of the beer is medium, medium-plus carbonation, and a medium-plus finish.  
 
At times I felt the malts thin out. It is a malty beer with expressive flavors. It is a solid Scotch Ale. I wanted a beefier malt profile to make it heavier.",4.12

Pours light straw coloured with minimal visable carbonation and a tight bubbled white head that leaves a nice amount of lacing . The smell is vague , malty and grassy and not very strong.

Overall, this is a good beer but , for me at least , not a great one . The citric acid was a little overpowering and (where I live) I can get beer I prefer in this style for cheaper .

Super clean, super light, perfectly balanced, and with a long, sweet finish. Outstandingly drinkable, but with enough going on to be interesting. Uniquely refreshing hops character, and uniquely complex malt profile for such a light beer. Can't say enough good things about it.

I remember hearing about OG Gonzo being an awesome beer when I first joined BA. I looked around for it for a while but never ended up finding it. Fast forward 4 years and I end up finding the barrel aged version instead. Let’s see if it can live up to my expectations from all those years ago 
 
Pours nearly pitch black with 2 fingers of tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing 
 
There is a hefty bitterness to the nose here, just really intense. I’m picking up on aromas of herbal hops, toasted oak, cacao nib, earthy whiskey, burnt toast, toffee, and light vanilla 
 
It shows a similar bitterness in taste, but it’s nicely done. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting cocoa powder, burnt coffee, dark toast, earthy whiskey, herbal hops, light caramel, and molasses. The swallow brings notes of burnt toast, herbal hops, earthy whiskey, toasted oak, cocoa powder, toffee, brown sugar, and light raisin 
 
A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a brisk and bitter beer. Finishes slightly sticky but goes down remarkably easy for the abv 
 
It’s nothing amazing like I was told it was back in the day, but it’s a very solidly done beer in the old school fashion",4.07

A roasted, malty aroma with hints of whiskey. 
 
A delicious porter. Tastes of chocolate, roasted malts with a distinct bourbon taste from the aging. Slightly acidic, bitter aftertaste. The 11.3% ABV is well hidden but it’s definitely lurking there. Not a brew you’ll want to rush through.

Gouden Carolus Tripel,"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a hazy, medium golden amber with a three finger white head that slowly dissipates to a thick cap with solid lacing. Aroma of lightly grainy malt, Belgian yeast, coriander, mystery stone fruit; somewhat muddled. Flavor is grainy malt, light generic citrus, light stone fruit and dried tropical fruit, particularly mango. Coriander and a touch of clove kick in at the finish with mild hint of hop bitterness. Medium bodied with moderate creaminess. This is a unique take on the tripel style; the general profile is very much classic tripel malt, yeast and spicing, but the fruit flavors are hard to identify, but very pleasant and intriguing. Fun to repeatedly sip and try to parse flavors. ABV well covered. The aroma was surprisingly muted and jumbled, but the flavor is excellent. Surprised to have never tried this tripel from Het Anker, but really hope it is permanent in our market. I'm a big tripel fan and it's rare to find a new one.

L: pale, brassy-amber liquid; fluffy pillow of foam atop which gracefully breaks up into a messy collar and cratery cap... laces a little, but that messy collar retains 
 
S: buttery biscuit with grainy perimeter tones; perhaps some mealy oxidation creeping in... touch of underripe banana skin; maybe a hint of coriander, but not much... subtle accents of phenolic booze and nutty, earthy yeast... overall, relatively bold intensity; approaches threshold of depth... gradually reveals a floral, herbal overtone 
 
T: oh yes, spiced for sure, much coriander, perhaps some orange peel, especially in the finish: citrus oils, semblance of pith... a few sips in and its malt background begins to fill in, lightly pancakey with a ghostly metallic highlight... its citrusy fruitiness slowly builds in the aftertaste on the palate floor, really helping to fill in its vertical spectrum of jagged flavorings 
 
F: very delayed emergence of warmth in the thorax... light-bodied, but with a luscious oily undercurrent... delicately foamy approach, but the spice and booze cleave it hard in the finish

Poured to a clear stemless wine snifter. 
A: Pours a dark mahogany / chestnut / ruby body. Small conjuring of tan bubbles that remains as a surface skimming. It does appear adequately carbonated, with some good sticky lacing. (""Legs""?) 
S: Aroma is deep & intricate. Definitely a beer to ponder after a quaff. It hits softly, but is super layered & complex. Aromas of smoke, cherry wood, some minor alcohol / booze fumes, vanilla, caramel, cream. Again, this aroma is soft, almost supple, but the authenticity on display here is the stunning part. 
T: Taste brings in what the nose promises. Notes of smoke, raisin, oak wood, vanilla, caramel, cream. Only slightly sweet, but never overly sugary or sticky. Subtle dark fruits - cherry, raisin, with just a hint of copper. (Bottle says this beer is brewed in a 1738 copper kettle, before being fermented on oak). 
Mouthfeel is absolutely perfect for this type of beer, carbonation is lowww, super easy drinking for the modest 7.2% abv.

This smells like spiced bread, dried plums and raisins, molasses, and herbal hops. 
 
This is a pretty standard but very well done Belgian dark strong ale. There’s not too much in the way of spicing - light clove and a general warming spice character, along with a malt note that’s reminiscent of molasses and baked bread. There’s just a touch of slightly bitter hop character.

Corsendonk Christmas Ale,"Bottle with BB date 08/06/25, let sit out for 10 minutes before opening.  
 
Clear dark reddish-brown, with about 1 1/2 fingers of very fine light tan head. The head is very long-lasting , and maintains surface coverage for the duration, and produces some thin lacing whenever the glass is move.  
 
Smell is a vague mix of dried fruit, and a little bit of biscuity malt aroma. A hint of spiciness when swirled. 
 
Taste is raisin, fig, prune, leather, with a bit of light spice (coriander+pepper+allspice) towards finish.  
 
Feel is medium, lightly-sticky initially, followed by moderate carbonation tingle, finishing (again) lightly sticky, leaving the tongue feeling coated.  
 
Nice one. A classic for a reason. :) Had it before, but appreciating it even more with analysis.",4.21
Corsendonk Christmas Ale,"11.2oz bottle into a goblet. Best by 8/6/25. 
 
Looks very good in the glass. Dark reddish brown body with a strong off white head which retains well leaving a sheet of lacing. 
 
Smooth malty aroma with the barest hint of fruit. 
 
On tasting, smooth, malty, dark, strong(ish) so easy to drink, belying the 8.1abv.  
 
Mouth full, finish slightly warming, with a featherlight bitter touch. 
 
Overall, really nice easy drinking though strong winter ale. Happy to have another 3 in reserve.",4.13
Corsendonk Christmas Ale,,5
Corsendonk Christmas Ale,"Best before 8-6-25. 11.2oz bottle poured into a tulip.  
 
Pours mahogany with ruby hues; big fluffy and creamy light khaki head that falls slowly leaving great retention and sticky lacing.  
 
The aromas have a subtle blend of malts and yeasts. Some caramel coming through along with some banana. Some toast as well.  
 
The flavors basically follow the nose for the most part. Lots of toast. More caramel and banana. Some bubblegum. Some cocoa and chocolate. Some raisins and dark fruits. Subtle bitterness to go with a subtle sweetness. Yeasts do their thing. Solid malt backbone. Finishes clean. Alcohol is well hidden.  
 
Mouthfeel is nice and what you would expect from a Belgian beer. It's medium to full-bodied with active carbonation. It's sharp, spritzy, smooth, fluffy and slightly creamy.  
 
This is a solid dark Belgian brew. It has everything that you'd expect from the style, more or less. It's not flashy, but the craftsmanship is on point and takes this one to the next level. I like it.",3.82
Corsendonk Christmas Ale,"333 ml bottle 
Best Before Date: 08/06/25 
Glass: chalice/goblet (which is which?) 
ABV: 8.1% 
Temp: 50.5 F 
 
 
Look:  
Dark but clear mahogany that appears almost chestnut until held to light. A dense and creamy 1-finger high khaki head tops things off. The head fills what is left of the glass after the beer has been poured, and the head stays. And stays. And stays. With hardly any degradation. Lacing is excellent, once room for it has been made. 
 
Aroma:  
A captivating note of soft spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, very light cloves, and star anise. There are also notes of dark brown sugar and some dark and/or dried fruits like raisin, currants, prunes, plums, and some figs. Also faint notes of other fruits such as ripe bananas. A nice malty scent is also in there, but underneath everything else and hiding in the background. 
 
Taste:  
Bready malts that are deep and somewhat dark. The spices and fruits from the aroma are here, and the spices are amped up a notch. These are joined by some citrus and orange peel and by some notes that are reminiscent of a port wine. There is a moderate but restrained bitterness throughout the sip that balances things out quite well. The sip finishes a bit dry and mildly spicy. And even a very slight touch tart. 
 
Feel:  
Crisp but also smooth with a touch of creaminess. The body is medium-light. 
 
Overall:  
A very nice BDS Christmas Ale. Solid in all aspects. I think that I just may add this to my Christmas Rotation.",4.26

Skunk spray, banana, dry wheat & mild booze heat flavors.

Tripel,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass 
Appearance – The beer pours a very lightly hazed yellow-amber color with a small head of white foam. The head fades rather fast, leaving a bit of streaky lace on the sides of the glass.  
Smell – The aroma is quite heavy of a yeasty and spicy aroma, with lots of coriander and clove. Along with these smells comes a rather strong showing of banana and bubblegum as well as orange and candied sugar. Notes of white pepper and a rather decently strong doughy smell are there as well, and with a touch of hay and grass, a sweet and inviting aroma is produced overall. 
Taste – The taste stars out with a sweet candied sugar, orange, and banana flavor mixed with some grape juice and a sweet doughy taste. At the same time the spice that was in the nose, is well represented in the tongue, with flavors of coriander and clove as well as some light white pepper and lemongrass. At the taste advances the sweetness gets slightly stronger, all while the doughy flavor takes on more of a cracker malt taste; drying things out a touch. At the same time a yeastiness becomes more pronounced as well. Toward the end, the spice gets more intense and is joined by some lemon and a bit of hay, leaving one with a sweeter, but very pleasant taste to linger on the tongue. 
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is crisp with a higher carbonation level and lots of prickly carbonation bubbles. For the style the feel is fantastic and makes for a nice sipper. 
Overall – A quite nice triple that is big on sweetness, but still very drinkable and pleasurable. Quite nice.",4.23

Pours near black with a short (1/2"") head that dissipates to a trace. The aroma is wonderful, I got loads of malts with notes of caramel, and a whiff of maybe smoked barley? The taste follows the aroma and it too is wonderful. In addition to the caramel I sense licorice and that smoke essence. The feel is more than I expected, just that good. This is definitely one I would be happy to have in the cellar on a regular basis. I sipped it slowly so as to savor the experience, so good.",4.64

Aroma has notes of roasted malts, some dark fruits, licorice, and dry cocoa. There is a slight smoky aroma more reminiscent of smoked bbq (as someone described it) more that it is just straight up smoked malts like in a rauchbier. Finally you do get some of that lager yeast coming through on the nose. 
 
Taste follows the nose, you get some roasted malts, cocoa, dark fruit and licorice, with a smoky finish. Very earthy herbal hops provide some bittering on the back end. Light smokiness comes through as the beer warms up with a definite smoked bbq like quality.

Long aftertaste of bitterness mixing hops and dark chocolate. Tart roasted bite at the front on the other hand. And in the middle both blend harmoniously.

Nose is of smoked barbecue, with a rich sweetness. Pork ribs slathered in BBQ sauce comes to mind. Subtle black licorice as well.  
 
Thin mouthfeel; dangerously drinkable for such a dark porter.  
 
Slight metallic flavor on first sip; gives way to malted chocolate flavor. As the beer progresses, the metallic taste (which all Baltic Porters have to me) goes away and reveals a roasted character. By far the best BP I've ever had; complex & enigmatic. Would definitely buy again (and have).",4.34

The aroma has a pleasantly mild wheat backbone. Modest spicy yeast dances with light coriander, kicking up some dust in its wake. 
 
Wheat bread and a mild sensation of overripe banana gives way to coriander. The coriander is mild, yet much more present than the aroma had suggested. The finish is faint and lingering. Warmth reveals unmistakable lime flavors, and generally brings significant improvements to the experience. The bitterness and sweetness are both mild and balanced. 
 
It has a creamy, full body, with a soft Jersey cotton texture. Carbonation is modest, while the alcohol is as expected. It has a dryness front to back.

Look:  
Opaque chestnut brown crowned with a half-finger tan head. The head settles to a ring of tan lace. 
 
Aroma:  
Rich and sweet maltiness. Caramel. Toffee. Brown sugar. Stone fruits, especially cherry. Noticeable notes of oak and bourbon whiskey (vanilla, the aforementioned cherry and brown sugar, some coconut, wood, touch of baking spice). 
 
Taste:  
All of the notes from the aroma are here. The caramel, toffee, and brown sugar, and cherry (dark/black cherry) are more prominent in the taste than in the aroma. As is the coconut, though not as much. The alcohol can be noticed and provides nice mild but warming burn (which isn't surprising). The sip finishes warm and semi-dry. 
 
Feel:  
Creamy and a tad sticky. There is a nice warmth from the alcohol. The body is medium. 
 
Overall:  
A complex and enjoyable Barleywine of the English persuasion. This beer is drinking nicely at 6.25 years old (and 1.25 years past its Best By Date) and makes quite the nice winter time sipper.",4.3

The stone fruit is the key to this, and the base beer (Blithering Idiot). I am literally salivating. 
 
The caramel and toffee flavors are forward on the taste, as they should be, and there’s a delicious oaky flavor from the barrel, which also provides a bit of alcohol heat which fits this big beer (13.3% ABV) perfectly, but it’s that stone fruit that reels me in - the dark cherry flavor is the PERFECT complement to the aforementioned components. I could drink gallons of this.

The label says that this was aged in ""oak barrels"", but it's pretty clear from the smell wafting into my nostrils that those barrels once contained whisky. And so, too, does this beer. Lots of it. Not picking up the usual ""barrel char"" notes that these bourbon barrel aged beers often lend; this is just neat, straight-up whisky. The base beer offers up some caramel notes and bitter hops and I'm getting rather excited that this is a proper barleywine and not just a triple IPA. *sips* Oh, it is! Malty sweet caramel up front with drying whisky to balance things on the back end. Very, very nice. Soft, ""Sugar Daddy"" caramel lingers on the palette. Pretty well full-bodied with proper ""chew"". Mild bittering. I really like this one. It's a little cold (left it in the fridge overnight), but I'm going to sip slowly and let it warm to see if it opens up any hidden complexities. Something tells me it will.",4.41

Insanity,"Poured a 12 ounce bottle of undetermined date (WTF Weyerbacher?) into a Lost Abbey long stemmed tulip. Thick off white head over a clear brownish ruby color. Smell was muted at cellar temperature but eventually warmed up and reflected malty dark fruit notes and brown sugar. Taste reflected the smell but more immediate and intense. Mouthfeel was deceivingly light for an ale of this heft. 
 
For some reason (again WTF Weyerbacher with no data on the bottle) I was expecting this to be an American style barleywine, not having access to BA at the bottle shop (or being too lazy to look it up), so only bought a single. It's still not nearly as complex as JW Lee's Harvest Ale or Thomas Hardy, but perhaps aging can help that. Maybe not but this is too good not to experiment with.",4.38

Yeah, that one. Actually 2010 bottle, so even older.  
 
Anyhoo, all geeked for it, it pours a ruddy brown with light red/pink notes to it. Claims of bullshit fill the air. I think we were up like 20-0 after 2 innings so this popped off celebration style. Didn't amass much of a head, but it was still carbonated. The aroma had a moderate amount of raspberry to it, but also pervasive sourness.  
 
The taste was enjoyable, its easy to hurr durr acidity warheads teeth enamel jokes, but this wasn't terrible. Yes, it was overly sour, but thankfully Michael crushed half the bottle. It seemed maltier than most lambics. I guess they're calling it a wild ale now. Makes sense. One dimensional, raspberry + sour power. But whatever.",3.62

Raspberry,"Reviewed from (long-standing) notes. 2012 vintage 750 mL bottle, stored appropriately, and opened on 1/21/18. Poured into an El Catador Barrel-Aged glass. 
 
A: Hazy to murky copper-ish red, with quite a bit of visible carbonation. Forms a thin white head that doesn't stick around. 
 
S: Big lactic sour, with a much milder acetic tang underneath. Big underripe raspberries and cherries and malic acid punch. Lactobacillus funk, cheese, and feet. Light cracker malts, and I think a touch of woody dryness. Maybe a touch of Brettanomyces funk and dryness, but it’s buried under all the lactic and fruity sourness. This isn’t quite nose-hair-searing, but it’s smells sour for sure. 
 
T: Again, a big lactic sourness up front. Raspberry fruity accompanied by some serious malic acid. Lactobacillus funk again, maybe some Pediococcus on the palate. Cheese and barnyard and horsey. Some light cracker malts, then a sizeable punch of lemony citric acid near the swallow with more seriously tart raspberries. 
 
M: Average body for most American sours. Carbonation sensation a bit towards the low end. Low alcohol flavors. 
 
O: This was a pretty darn tasty fruited sour, even after extended years. The age seems to have rounded out some of the acidity, at least compared to some of the other Upland sours I’ve had. It’s not the most tasty or complex or nuanced raspberry sour you’ll ever have. But it’s enjoyable.",3.93

Boskeun,"Pours a hazy (I always aspirate my yeast back in), deep orange colour. Plenty of bubbles run up the side of the glass, supporting an incredibly dense head that has these big rocky bubbles at the top. Gorgeous honestly  
 
A sweet, mild, herbal and yeasty aroma. Banana and general phenolic spices present as well. 
 
All my last reviews have been simple, ‘taste follows the nose’, but not this one. The aforementioned aromas are present in the palate but it’s quite a complex and interesting flavour profile. First off, the ABV is present but in a complementary way. It inflects off of the delicious yeasts and drives up the spicy phenolic character quite a bit. Cloves, cinnamon on the back end… cardamom? Not sure if that’s what I’m thinking but there’s something else in there too.  
 
Banana bread, honey, the floral notes in the aromas are transformed into more earthy tones here. Maybe this sounds strange but, apple peel? Usually I taste fruit in beers it’s just ‘apple’ or ‘pear’, rarely peel unless it’s citrus zest in hop forward beers. But I get a real apple peel flavour here. 
 
Medium-light bodied with moderate carbonation that is fairly active, lightly tickling bubbles. Beer definitely leans to the dryer side on the finish, and despite the sweet notes that are all throughout the beer, the dryer finish brings out the bitterness that’s present in the background of this beer.  
 
Well, if I knew this was an Easter beer I would’ve saved it for Easter, but only after I cracked it did I read it was. A beer I’ve never, ever seen in Canada nor will we likely ever, this was a special gift from a friend who brought it back from the good ol United States. It’s beautiful looking, complex and delicious. Goodness me I wish I had another one to open on Easter. Oh well, what can you do. This is Belgian goodness in a bottle. I’d honestly say I’m liking it as much as Orval, and I’ve got 5 of those in my cellar!! Hope to be able to get another one of these soon!",4.21

Smoked Porter,"2022 vintage 
 
Strangely enough, this is one of the first beers I heard talked about on BA when I joined. At the time the thought of a smoked beer seemed foreign to me, and I spent a bit of time in my early days of beer trying to find this locally, ultimately to never find it and forget about it. So when I saw it in Chicago I was suddenly brought back a few years and decided to instantly buy the bottle. Let’s see what one of my first wants is all about 
 
Pours completely pitch black with a finger of tan head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing 
 
The smoke is huge in the nose, but makes for a strange combination with the almost creamy underlying Porter. I’m picking up on aromas of charred oak, campfire smoke, milk chocolate, vanilla, dark toast, brown sugar, light earthy hops, and burnt caramel 
 
It takes the smokiness a bit too far in taste for my liking, but ultimately it’s still enjoyable. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting beechwood smoke, charred oak, milk chocolate, raisin, dark toast, and molasses. The swallow brings notes of campfire smoke, charred oak, acrid coffee, burnt sugar, molasses, and light milk chocolate 
 
A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a slick yet smoky beer. Finishes mostly dry 
 
Well, I finally had it. Is it good? Yeah. Amazing? No, it’s not quite balanced enough to say that, but it was nice to finally try it. It’s funny that this is my third review in a row that is a Smoked Porter, and despite it being a long time want, I eated it the lowest of the three",3.96

The smell is delicious. It has a mix of fruity notes and light bread notes mixed with an earthy bitterness from the hops. 
 
The taste is fantastic. The Belgian spice notes dominate the taste at first, but the apple and pear notes come in rather quickly without displacing the yeast notes. There is also a light caramel taste to it as well. While the beer starts sweet, it starts to become more bitter than sweet quickly. The earthy bitter hop notes come out towards the finish to round out the beer. 
 
The feel is amazing! It starts off with a bit of stickiness before becoming fairly dry! The carbonation is tingling while the texture is fluffy smooth with a medium body to it. 
 
Overall, this is a fantastic beer worth getting and having if available.",4.43

Avec Les Bons Voeux,"Purchased from the international Beer Collector Christmas sale in November 2021 and drunk in July 2022. 
 
The beer comes in a sturdy-looking, green, corked bottle. There's a satisfying pop and hiss as the cork is pryed loose followed by a whiff of ""smoke"" and an immediate orchard fruit scent at the neck of the bottle. 
 
On the nose, as previewed at the opening, there's peach and apricot, spicy yeast, vanilla and pepper. Wow, I've not even had it in my mouth and I can tell it's going to be something complex and special. 
 
In the mouth, spicy Belgian yeast dominates at first, but the orchard fruits quickly announce their presence. There also the vanilla from the nose and bitter orange peel and candied lemon. At the swallow there is substantial, earthy bitterness that's quite sharp and not at all what I was expecting. The finish is dry but the bitterness lingers long after the swallow.  
 
Mouthfeel is luxurious. It's smooth and counteracts the lingering bitterness well. There's quite a bit of carbonation, but the sweetness, bitterness and bubbles all work together seemlessly. A follow-up mouthfeel demands attention. 
 
Overall, this is a magnificent beer. There's complexity that isn't always evident in saisons or farmhouse ales, which takes the beer beyond the standard Belgian yeast, lemon candy and pepper/herbal profile that those styles can fall back on. I can't remember a better saison or farmhouse ale and in fact can't remember too many better beers full stop.

Don De Dieu,"Missing something from the real Belgian tripel-- perhaps it's missing the evolution from sharp coriander to a smooth sweet finish. Instead, this iteration of the umbroque line has a rather dull evolution, while still hitting the right notes.  
 
A bit disappointing considering since this was marketed as a Belgian WHEAT beer. As such, I thought it would be a Quebecoise take on Hoegaarden. But instead it was just a worse version of Tripel Karmeliet with some wheat notes.",3.54

Mouth feel is high-medium to full with moderate carbonation. There is a little warming from the bourbon at the finish.

Ipswich Oatmeal Stout,"Poured from a can into a pint glass 
Appearance – The beer pours a deep brown color with a small head of light brown head. The head has a decent level of retention, fading slowly over time and leaving a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. 
Smell – The aroma of the brew is strong of a roasted malt and oaty smell mixed with some coffee and a bit of brown sugar. Along with these smells comes notes of fudge and crème. Other light notes of brown bread and caramel are there as well, giving a dark and roasty smell overall. 
Taste – The taste begins with a very roasty and toasty flavor mixed with lots of coffee and some nice oat flavors. Other flavors of toast and roast as well as some caramel and cocoa are there as well. There is a bit of a brownie like flavor as well as some notes of nuttiness. Toward the end the sweetness and roastiness increase a bit, leaving one with a rather dark and roasty taste to linger on the tongue. 
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is thick and chewy with a moderate carbonation. For the big rich flavors the feel is good and makes for a nice slow sipper. 
Overall – A decent oatmeal stout nice for a cooler fall day. Rich in flavor and very representative of the style.",4.09

The Sixth Glass Quadrupel Ale,"12oz bottle ""Best By"" March 27th, 2024 
 
On an average pour, a massive 4 finger off white to tan head formed. Dissipated to 3 fingers after a couple minutes. Streams of fine carbonation come out of a very hazy dark amber body. After trying to get the rest into my glass, the 4 fingers of head immediately came back. Sticky but sparse lacing forms. 
 
Aroma is slightly boozy with a nice Belgian yeast character that brings some sweet spicy and lightly fruity notes. A caramel sweetness and light nuttiness is present from the dark malts. Comes off as a big beer but not a 10%+ beer. 
 
The taste is very close to the smell with some added hop bitterness. Less fruity esters, but the spicy Belgian character mixes with an alcohol flavor making this pretty intense, on the spectrum of non barrel aged beers. Despite the initial intensity, once the bitterness and alcohol dies down after a few seconds, a malty smooth nuttiness, and caramel sweetness round everything out. 
 
The feel full bodied with a definite maltiness, but this beer is highly attenuated and not as thick as doppelbocks. The alcohol isn't felt at first, but as you drink more a slight warming sensation begins within the body. Long but smooth finish. A very nice armchair/celebration beer. 
 
Overall, this was a pretty nice beer. Also a very good candidate for cellaring. I held onto this beer for roughly 5 months, but it was in the fridge. Maybe it improved? I'm not sure.",4.01

Moinette Blond,"Delightful. My first strong Belgian pale I think. I usually go for Strong Dark, Dubbels, and Quads. This tastes similar, but a tad lighter with a touch more bitterness. Nicely sweet, and paired well with a roast duck dinner. It was better as it warmed up, I think I had it too cold initially. No hint of the 8.5%.",4.02
Moinette Blond,"330 mL bottle from the LCBO; best before Aug 2022 and served at cellar temperature. 
 
Pours a bright, clear golden-yellow hue, producing just over a finger of foamy, sparkling white head. It withers away over the next several minutes, leaving behind a thin cap and wide, frothy collar, with a narrow band of lace also having been deposited. I'm getting orchard fruits and yeastiness on the nose - appleskin, clove and white pepper, with hints of banana, pear and candi sugar sweetness, all layered atop of a bready pale malt backdrop. Not bad at all. 
 
A quality Belgian strong ale; the flavours follow the nose, with grainy, bready pale malts providing support for notes of apple, white grape, apricot and pear. Hints of lemony citrus and bubblegum crop up as well, with yeasty, spicy aspects of clove towards the finish, and just a tad of floral hops & earthiness into the aftertaste. Medium-full in body, with moderate carbonation levels that froth up in the mouth a little, gently tickling the tongue; feels smooth and velvety soft in the mouth. The 8.5% is a tad noticeable, but not in an intrusive way, as it blends into the profile quite effectively. If it weren't for the small serving size, this might be a much more dangerous beer, particularly given the ease with which I tossed it back. 
 
Final Grade: 4.23, an excellent A-. Moinette Blonde is a very solid BSPA that I enjoyed the hell out of. Now, I don't know if I'd put it on the same pedestal as Duvel, but in terms of quality it's at least in the vicinity of that ballpark. The stock around here is beginning to dwindle, but hopefully I'll manage to pick up another bottle or two for short term (less than 2 y) storage in the cellar. Highly recommended to any BA with an appreciation for Belgian pale ales.",4.23

Moinette Blond,"This is a refreshing beer, you taste the belgium style, slight hops, light citrus malt aroma, smooth to the pallet, and a nice aftertaste. This is a great Belgium pale ale and probably one of the better ones I've had. Definitely a summer drink and dangerous for 8.5 ABV.",3.77

Moinette Blond,"The look is lovely Belgian and the nose is equally good funky saison. But the taste is somewhat disappointing.

Really, you could do worse if nothing is available in its class. Otherwise....meh.",3.95
Moinette Blond,,4
Moinette Blond,"Color of light shimmering gold with white cap and lacing. 
 
A clean aroma of ripe fruits such as apricot, pear and peach. 
 
Taste is a combination of the scent fruits along with touches of yeast rolls and a bit of spice. Can't quite nail down the spice as it's very light but cinnamon and clove come to mind. Complex, sophisticated and quite refreshing. 
 
Light to medium texture with balancing carbonation. 
 
In scent, texture and taste this is a good deal milder than I usually get from a Belgian Blond. Not de minimis but certainly no block buster.",4.1
Moinette Blond,"330 ml bottle served very cool into a chalice. LCBO purchase for about $3.35CDN. Best before August 2022. 
 
Appearance - Hazy rich dark golden color, capped with a finger of white head that actually fizzles out much quicker than I thought it would. Sparse lacing clings to the edges of the glass. 
 
Smell - Powdery yeast, bready donuts, some fruit, namely apple, pear and peach. Inviting and warm. A touch perfumey as well. 
 
Taste - Light and bready, some funky yeast, slight bits of candi sugar and more sweet fruits, apple and pears most with a peachy sensation. So good and easy to drink. 
 
Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, booze is so well hidden and well carbonation, fizzy and expressive without being gassy, 8.5% ABV is wonderfully hidden. 
 
Overall - Yeah, a strong Belgian Pale Ale brewed by Dupont, what where you expecting. Delicious and inviting, it's not quite Duvel, but pretty much the next best thing in the style, really should try to do a comparison between this, La Chouffe, Duvel and Delirium seems like a fairly even 4 way fight for supremacy and what could wrong in that situation?",4.26

Oud Beersel Oude Kriek Vieille,"Review 1538 
My continuation for trying a bunch of different beers. This beer is a fruit lambic I picked up a month or so back. The beer is 46 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour of the beer created a two-fingered pinkish head with excellent retention. The head did not leave any lacing on the glass as it slowly dissipated. The head is creamy and foamy and settling to the bottom of the liquid. The color of the beer is 0reddish-purple with clarity.  
 
The first aromas in the beer are cherries, lightly toasted malts, and sour lemons. Nosing further, I detect a touch of horse blanket, wet grass, toasted crackers, oak, and hay.  
 
The flavors in the beer are cherries, fruity sweetness, oak, leather, a touch of farmyard funk, sourness like lemons, toasted crackers, hay, and lightly toasted malts.  
 
The mouthfeel of the beer is tannic, tart, and carbonated.  
 
The body of the beer is light, high carbonation, and medium finish.  
 
The beer has a beautiful tartness and finished crisp. The fruit comes through but is not overpowering. The touch of farmyard funk is pleasant and gives the beer uniqueness. Solid fruit lambic, I enjoyed it.",4.25
Oud Beersel Oude Kriek Vieille,"750ml green bottle. Caged and corked bottle. Label lists ABV% as 6, for ""Belgian Cherry Ale"". 
Dark reddish brown colored body. Slightly pink, beige colored head, which persists as a thin bubble cap. Just a few small spots of lacing left behind. 
Aroma has cherry and oak/leather farmyard funk. 
Taste is a balance of cherry sweet and tart. The funk is more in the later portion, and shows oak, lemon, and leather. The more tart cherry and oak revisit in the aftertaste. 
Medium mouth feel, with a dry finish. Good carbonation. 
Sublime and balanced use of the cherry with the base lambic. All works together and nothing out of place.",4.4

The flavor is a straightforward iteration of the style, but done to near-perfection. Cherries dominate throughout: organic tasting, very juicy, backed up by yeast spice and tartness. It's very smooth and drinkable from start to finish, never getting too sour or sweet. The balance is exquisite.",4.5

Wee Heavy,"Had this when I was visiting the old brewery. Pours a dark mahogany and chestnut brown almost leaning into black territory. We're talking ~ looks similar to an imperial porter at this point. Tan colored head, 3/5"". Good retention. Solid looking beer. The aroma is a mixture of earthy malt, toffee bitterness, booziness and mild smoked caramel sweetness.  
 
Taste is chewy but not thick. More of that brown and smoked malt (in a minor way, not rauchbier levels) aspect. Mingles some dark fruit like influence. Mouth feel then gives more nuanced complexity in that you start getting more of a nuttiness angle to compliment all the other stuff. Moderate heat, which means at a double digit abv, it hides the alcohol decently. Thinner body than the appearance and taste would seem to indicate normally. Carbonation on point. This seems like a good candidate for an evening around a fire, especially campfires.",3.67
Wee Heavy,"Probably my favorite Wee Heavy. Perfectly balanced, nice and boozy, just the right amount of sweetness and not overly malty. This is one of my go-to's when visiting Alesmith and it remains a menu standard because of its consistently world-class brewing. Good stuff.",4.35

Cloudy to a high degree, but not perfectly blocking all light. Lovely uniform white cap promotes a lot of initial lacing. Feel is a bit light and bubbly and not quite as smooth as I expected.

L: Hazy, sunset yellow in the glass with a large pillowy head that didn't last as long as expected (yes, my glass is clean!). Small amounts of carbonation can be seen in the glass.  
 
S: Cloves, bubblegum, vanilla and candied lemon, all heading in the Dr Pepper cherry direction. No malt/wheat body discernable.  
 
T: Quite sweet, with the bubblegum and ripe pear. That Dr Pepper note is there too, but I wonder now if that's the ripe pear that I'm tasting. Regardless, it brings to mind that chalky Dr Pepper cherry taste that doesn't taste at all like cherry but remains stubbornly associated with it, There's a long, sweet finish with the vanilla coming out retronasally after the swallow. The overt bubblegum and extra sweetness mark this one down for me. 
 
M: Carbonation is mild and the mouthfeel is full and as expected from the hazy appearance of the beer. 
 
O: I'm resolutely sticking to the style in rating this one, and the sweetness that I pick up and that Dr Pepper note means the beer is not as refreshing and light as a Hefeweizen should be, so I'm marking it down.

Terrible,"These days I dont have much time to write reviews, but still want to put up some thoughts. Tons of people do in depth on look, smell, etc... Others do nice long proce. I think I might try to do nice, concise, in between reviews without reiterating what others say. 
 
Didn't know this was a Quad! I think the 10.5% is a nice middle line for Quads (many often much higher).  
 
A nice deep brown colour with ruby shade, with a lighter, washed out brown frothy head just around a finger with greath thickness and retention. Floral smells sure but malty sweetness, sweet bread, raisin and mild spice notes on the nose. 
 
A lovely mix of flavours somewhere between malt, sweet bread, and others. Opens with a great wooden flavour, kind of like oak but a little more mustiness to it. A big of dark chocolate but not particularly strong, did note some dried fruits, almost like cranberry-raisin mix. Yeasty flavours but not chewy like other quads or even other tripels. Spice is there but muted. Slight medicinal aspects on the finish with brown sugar, but not in the sweet way, more like the way where the sweetness ends and the mild brown sugar flavours lie on the tongue after a minute.  
 
Good carbonation, higher than expected, dense tiny bubbles. Smooths out over time, body is medium and not too thick whatsoever. Lighter bodied than you'd think, more carbonation than you'd think as well. Very unique little balance. Alcohol is well hidden... When it's cold. As it warms, even just a little, you feel it a bit more on the exhale. Not overwhelming, and it opens up the flavour to be a little sweeter, a little bit more sweetness, a little more spice and fruit like mild cinnamon and plum/raisin, and rum like notes. Great, unique Quadrupel. It's not a malt bomb, it's not dessert like or super sweet, it's not super thick, and there's some mild balancing bitterness here. Very interesting!",4.19

Zonker Stout,"This was another beer that I picked up at the Whole Foods in Jackson, Wyoming when I was out that way not too long ago. Don’t have this style much but when you come across something this highly rated, it’s worth a go! 
 
Indeed, this lived up to its lofty rating a land description as this was dark, varied, and well-balanced. Plenty of mocha head topped the liquid out although the spotty lacing left behind should have been more extensive. That was the only underwhelming aspect of this brew as the roasted, rough nose was enough to draw me in. Lots of barley and dark chocolate in it as the taste contained hints of milk chocolate, raisin, currant, and licorice. Nuanced, varied, and a bit mysterious, this was dark without being burnt, full-flavored without being rich, and full bodied without being strong. Certainly, that was no easy feat! 
 
The carbonation was light as the flavors lingered and this was nicely roasted without being thin or sweet like espresso and coffee. I wouldn’t change the amount of alcohol in this as it was spot on, and the aftertaste was neither dry nor overtly strong. No date was written anywhere as it was a treat to see a map of the Snake River on the can once I peeled the label off. This held up well and was a clear-cut winner for it’s style as it deserved it’s rating on here. Indeed, I was glad to put this river through my liver!",4.18

Zonker Stout,"cant believe i have not rated this one until now, one of their classics and one of the best straight up stouts in the region, absolutely famous for a reason, no frills, old school extraordinarily well crafted, somehow still flies under the radar. black and shiny and frothy from the tap, looks gorgeously refined and silky, good body but not overly viscous for what it is. the nose is earthy and dry, no attempt at too much middle malt richness, dark chocolate, an almost irish thing to the yeast, some toasted breadiness, fresh ground coffee, and minerals, just a little alcohol, more at temperature, maybe oats or dark wheat in the mash here too, more nuance than most on the grain side without any real sweetness. the flavor has some charcoal character, an almost oak aged decadence and smoothness, but is yet still dry. more coffee, dark chocolate, light raisin, and mocha character, along with a silky texture than hangs around just long enough on the swallow and isnt quite neutral on the ferment, right on. subtle almost rye spice to this too, just a little more going on than in most of these, but all real subtle. they really dont make beer like this anymore, nowadays this would have vanilla and milk sugar in it, be 9% abv, and be bastardized beyond recognition. credit to snake river for a world class beer and for not feeling the need to make it trendy. if you built it they will come. it doesnt get much better than this in the style. i would love to try the nitro edition...",4.24

Zonker Stout,"12oz can stamped 03/02/21 poured into a tulip pint glass at fridge temp 6% ABV. The beer pours dense, black in color with generous and lasting mocha colored head. The head recedes slowly to a one inch cap and leaves a web of lacing covering the glass. The aroma is mild featuring dark cocoa & slight ash with a nutty, earthy undertone. The taste is more dark chocolate with a caramel balance not found in the aroma. Mild bitterness. The mouthfeel is silky & medium bodied with less than medium carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Overall, excellent. This is a superb example of a disappearing style. Export stouts, done well, offer the character of the imperials with much better drinkability. Would definitely acquire and drink again.",4.3
Zonker Stout,,4.84
Zonker Stout,"CAN: 12 fl oz pull-tab with an understated label. Nabbed as part of a sixer from a Total Wine & More in Colorado - I think for $9.99 USD plus tax? 
 
""Export Style Stout."" Currently ranked #1 on the top Stout - Foreign / Export list with a 93 overall score. 
 
6% ABV. 
 
Served cold into an oversized pint nonic snifter hybrid glass thingamajigger (I don't know what to call this glassware but it's fancy). 
 
APPEARANCE: Pours a gorgeous gilded tan head replete with loads of creamy softness. Robust...its starting ~6-7cm head height sticks around for a good 8 minutes or so, and rich thick lacing coats the sides of the glass as the head slowly recedes. Body colour is a true to style opaque black. No yeast/lees are visible within. 
 
Looks as an export stout ought to. I guess the head could be still more gilded and could have more of an imperial stout-like golden sheen to better effect, if we're really picking nits. I see nothing wrong with this appearance and it looks rather good. 
 
AROMA: Roasted barley is immediately obvious, buoyed by chocolate malt, dark malt sweetness, and burnt sugars. Hints of something from the licorice/fennel/aniseed family of herbs...I guess fennel. Burnt blackstrap molasses. Buried scintillae of caramelized sugars. 
 
Seems perfectly attenuated for the style, with a big roasty bitterness balanced by specialty chocolate malts. Seems like a carafa-driven export stout that's impeccably balanced judging by the aroma. 
 
I don't get any coffee-like aromatics, dark fruit, vanilla/vanillin, or actual chocolate (i.e. the chocolate aroma is solely chocolate malt-derived). 
 
Aromatic intensity is average. 
 
TASTE & TEXTURE: Big, roasty, and dry, with a nice undertone of burnt sugars and earthy fennel-like spice. No hop flavours are obvious...maybe some preservative-only herbal hop varietals. Chocolate malt joins with its dark malt backbone to give it some balancing sweetness without usurping the roast at the beer's heart. And the roast is lovely...this beer is chock full of carafa goodness, pleasing the roasted barley lover in all of us. 
 
Has a subtle dryness and coarseness that helps coax out depth of flavour from the carafa/roasted barley without detracting from the gooeyness on the back end that complements the smooth chocolate flavours. Rich without tasting too sweet; robust without being too boozy or harsh. A flirtation with silky softness towards the back end helps surface a brief hint of fudge and chocolate syrup before the roast banishes that sweetness back under its depths. 
 
Carbonation is perfect. Medium to full-bodied, which is apt for the style and this beer's flavour profile. 
 
OVERALL: This is an impeccably balanced export stout with no flaws and few shortcomings...I will say the subtle coffee-like flavour carafa tends to impart is absent here to its slight detriment, and I can't help but imagine some vanillin or vanilla bean flavours would liven it up. But while I can imagine it better with subtle tweaks, I can't find any faults or flaws; it's tremendously well brewed. 
 
Rivals Guinness' export stouts, which is no small feat in my book.

Oooh. I wish that I had transcribed the preceding before my Crack! of the vent, followed by an inverted Glug. I wanted a pseudo-cascade, which I got, but I should have treated it like the bloody Stanley Cup & worn white gloves & treated it reverentially, instead of as a cheap tart. It may be some residual bitterness over Linda Lou, a Wyomingite, who threw me over a quarter-century ago, eh? It performed admirably, forming two-plus fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, deep-brown head with very good retention. Color was coal Black/Opaque (SRM = 44) & as to light penetration? It sent out a bouncer to keep watch! 8=O Nose was beautiful - charcoal smoke; anise; treacle; toffee; coffee; dried dark fruits, such as raisins & prunes; burnt tobacco - think a smoked Maduro cigar. Mmm.  
 
I used to love Macanudo Maduros until I developed adult-onset asthma. Mmm, they were slow-burning & more flavorful than so many others. Try one, if you CAN.  
 
Mouthfeel was dense & thick, more like a R-hook into the tongue. POW! 8=O The taste was like a cut 'n' paste of this site's Style Guide - "" a very pronounced roasted character"", ""roasted grain and malt flavor with a coffee, chocolate, or lightly burnt grain character, although without a sharp bite"". 8=O Holy Picture Perfect, Batman! No wonder all of the awards. Finish was ""[m]oderately dry"" & I was left wondering how I have not had this before. This was an outstanding Foreign Stout!  
 
I am heavy on all-5s, despite the site's dictum to have them be a rarity. Fair dinkum. I didn't like the bouncer's glare & the feckin tongue punch put me off. Howzat? YMMV.",4.96

Taddy Porter,"Poured from a 12-oz bottle (undated) into a pint glass. 
 
Appearance: Very dark brown, with a large tan head that only gradually reduced but still left a portion, and plenty of lacing. 
 
Nose: Roasted malt, sweet raisin, maybe a bit of brown sugar. 
 
Mouthfeel: Medium thick, smooth, adequate carbonation. 
 
Attack: Follows the nose pretty closely; very gentle, just the slightest hint of spice. 
 
Finish: A bit of bitterness from the hops and dark roast, just to balance. 
 
Overall: This is an extremely drinkable brew, and would pair well with any meat. The gentleness of this (and other) English porters is a nice occasional change from the sometimes more full-flavored but also more bitter American porters, which I also love. I'm enjoying it.",4.06

L: clear, ruby-colored liquid with vinous-violet highlights; little pop on the cork removal, little foam build on pour... the foam breaks down quick, leaving little collar; almost looks still 
 
S: cherry hard candy perfumy aromatics, but not suggesting sweetness; that mixed with a barrel-funky champagne tone... fruit leather, earthy rain-soaked terrain, hint of fruit tart (pastry, dough), fringe of smoky phenolics 
 
T: mmm, much fruitier than the aromas let on, cherry and red grape, some dark plum as well, lingering dried red fruit in the dry aftertaste, much more malt depth as well... the fruit portion of this is relatively bloated, leaving the dying vitality of the lambic a touch buried; the expressions at this age are mature but still have character 
 
F: nearly still as far as carbonation... smudgy light-medium body, subtle acidic singe at the back of the palate... a sipper; too easy 
 
O: this may have lost a good portion of its zest and zip, but it's still a lovely, demure drop; basically drinks like an acidic, near smoky, moderately bright-fruity, medium-bodied wine; lacking the boozy cut of a standard-strength vino... at this stage, it's still tasty, but it doesn't compare to the standard Mariage Parfait in flavor impact, and I had a 2014 bottle of that recently (2228)",4.19

I Crack!ed open the vent & CANmenced a slow, gentle Glug into the awaiting glass. I was overjoyed when it created two-plus fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, tawny head all on its own without any bidding. Color was solid Amber (SRM = > 7, < 9) with NE-quality clarity. Nose was utterly resinous with pine & now my hophead mouth was watering! Think of it - no haze, no tropical fruit, no B.S.! Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was so full of pine that I thought that I was holding the knob end of George Brett's bat! Mmmm. This was exactly the sort of thing that I had been jonesing for! It had a light woodiness and a little bit of a peach flavor to accompany the intense pine with a bit of biscuitiness. Mmmm, I was really pleasantly surprised since I thought that this type of beer was either impossible or illegal to produce currently. I jest, of course, but this was a welcome throwback to the sorts of beers that originally got my attention & made me realize that I am a self-described, self-avowed hophead. Finish was dry, bitter and just the way that I like them. YMMV.",4.16
Workhorse IPA,"The problem with some WC Style IPA’s is that the brewer puts the abv above the flavor. Not on this beer though. This is a well balanced ipa, throughly impressed.

What is there of the fruit registers as sour cherry (I'd also buy raspberry), but it's far in the background.

Stille Nacht,"11.6oz bottle. No dating information found. 
Cloudy, deep gold colored body. It took three pours, because of the rising head, to empty the bottle. The white head rises and then coalesces to a thick cap and ring. 
Aroma of green apple and coriander. Expressive yeast. 
Taste is a combination of flavors - dark fruit and green apple, toasted malt, and fruity hops (tangerine and lime). The malts hold the hops in the aftertaste.

Cadillac Mountain Stout,"Came upon this when ordering from Craft Beer Cellar. I love complex coffee-forward beers so this sounded like a good choice. I had to drink from the can so I won’t be able to comment on the color, head or lacing. 
Even from the can I can smell a roast coffee, dark cherry and cocoa. 
The taste is much complex than what I got from the smell. A combination of dark chocolate and roast coffee, toast, leather and a bit of ash as it wamrs. 
Mouthfeel is of a medium body with moderate carbonation that is extremely smooth.

Cadillac Mountain Stout,"Time to knock out another style topper!

Stout was selected World Champion Dry Stout 1995 and the best hard-to-find beer in America by Men’s Journal."" Cool shit. Let's see if it can live up to the expectations I've built up in my head after having this marked as a ""want"" for 3 years 
 
Pours a muddy medium brown with a finger of tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing 
 
As expected, the roast is very evident in the nose, but it is nicely balanced as well. I'm picking up on aromas of acidic coffee, dark toast, charred malt, toffee, sweet honey, herbal hops, and cocoa powder 
 
It's also quite smooth in taste for the amount of roasted malt that's present. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting dark chocolate, medium roast coffee, burnt toast, caramel, herbal hops, and dark cherry. The swallow brings notes of acidic coffee, cocoa powder, earthy hops, dark toast, toffee, light raisin, and a touch of char 
 
A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a roasty and slick beer. Finishes mostly dry and surprisingly refreshing 
 
Yeah, this shit is awesome. Super easy drinking even for a style where drinkability is pretty important. Definitely deserving of its ranking. I think I'll have to stock up on more now that I found it",4.26

But, not so much more than others within the style, even the great ones. To its credit, there is also much more than the banana hit. The notes described almond and vanilla presence and vanilla is a definite. There's also some cinnamon, or maybe clove reference that, with the ABV, provides a nice bite. Overall, this drinks mostly sweet and spicy. The aforementioned stickiness is much better than it being too thin. There's no glass lacing and little alcohol hit, which is only an asset to the overall taste. This hits all the right notes for a Belgian Quad, so those that love them will love this one.",4.19

Beautiful sweetness with a very tiny touch of tart. Incredible beer.",4.69
Goudenband,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter 
Appearance – The beer pours a dark ruby brown red color with a small head of tan foam. The head fades rather fast, leaving a touch of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. 
Smell – The aroma of the brew is rather strong of dark fruit smells of plum and prune, mixed with a touch of caramel apple and some cherry. Other aromas of candied sugar and yeast are there as well, mixing in with some notes of roasted ready malts and brownies. A hint of cola and spice are there as well, creating a nice inviting aroma overall. 
Taste – Thes taste starts out with a nice cherry and plum sweetness with some brown bread and candied sugar flavors. There are nice roasty notes that get stronger toward the middle of the taste profile, with them later fading a touch toward the end. At the same time the dark fruit are joined by even more flavors, with some raisin and apple coming along. All throughout there is also some yeasty flavors and some light notes of sourness, being of a tart raspberry and vinegar flavor. A bit of coriander and some oak develop as well, and with a tiny touch of char at the end, one is left with a dark fruited, very lightly soured and nicely balanced taste to linger on the tongue. 
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is light and thinner with a carbonation level that is high. For the style and the mix of flavors the feel is great and it makes for one dangerously easy sipper. 
Overall – A very nice and tasty lightly sour Belgium ale. One I will certainly seek out again.",4.35

Goudenband,"Having this beer on draft at Lizardville in Bedford, OH. Served to me in a tulip glass, this beer draws a very dark copper/amber color with A slightly off-white had that’s about an inch thick on first drawn and served. Head eventually settles to a medium sized ring lining the inside of the glass with some very small spots of surface foam. Barely any lacing to speak of. Aromas of some toasted, bready malts, notes of vinegar and lactate along with some fruity esters. A very similar flavor profile, with a toasted, bready malt presence to start off with that has hints of molasses and brown sugar sweetness. This is followed by some guide notes of apple, cherry, and dates along with a bit of lactate and vinegar that give it the nice sour note that blends so well with the molasses and brown sugar presence. Rounded out with a bit of a woody flavor. Although all of the different flavors are pretty subtle overall, this beer has a pretty complex flavor profile that I’m enjoying quite a bit. Has a somewhat crisp, also smooth, just slightly prickly, light to medium bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Has a nice, long finish and all the different flavors linger nicely on my palate for a long time after each sip.

This smells like damp wood, cherry juice, green apple, pear, and red wine vinegar. 
 
This is simultaneously too sweet and too vinegary for me - it's kind of a cloying medicinal sweetness for me, and when mixed with the old stale vinegar aspects, it definitely clashes. There's some nice woodiness and cherry skin, but it just doesn't work out for me. I know it's a classic beer, and maybe I'm missing out on something here, but it's just a contradictory set of flavors for me.

Appearance: Hazy/murky copper-red color, with a thin white head that died back. A few islands of lacing here and there. Sadly, not the best looking beer.  
 
Smell: Definite raspberry note. A little bit of underlying yeastiness and some funk as well. Starting to wonder if 2 years after bottling this is taking on some lambic character.  
 
Taste: So not a lambic - it's not that tart/sour. Definite raspberry note, with some underlying aspects of a Belgian tripel (herbal leafy hop note, some muted Belgian yeast character). I feel like the Belgian character may be somewhat lost here.  
 
Mouthfeel: Good thickness, quite sticky and somewhat juice-like. Light carbonation. Still - it held its carbonation this long.  
 
Overall / Drinkability: For a beer that is over 2 years old....it's still got some of it's original character, but the Belgian character is mostly swamped out from the Raspberry that still dominates this far on. So for an unexpected cellared beer, it's okay.

Poured reddish amber, deeply hued, and sported a manila colored 1 cm head for a minute or two, leaving behind a thin ring which left regular lacing. 
The aroma is still all about the raspberries. But there is a secondary note in there that reminds me, of all things, angel food cake. Hmmmm. 
The flavor starts out strong with raspberry but later mellows to a semi sweet malty ale that is sheer pleasure to drink. The angel food cake shows up in the flavor as well, very curious and very tasty. 
The feel took me back a bit, far more viscous than expected, but that's likely on me. This is a fruited ""Strong"" Belgian ale and a little viscosity isn't misplaced. Just unexpected. Maybe fresh the carbonation balances it out more.

Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Finishes a tad thin.  
 
Overall - A disappointing brew that started off on the wrong foot. Nearly loosing half the beer due to gushing is a terrible sign of this brewery's quality control. Perhaps this was an off-bottle.",3.39
Abbaye Des Rocs Grand Cru Belgian Special Brown,"1.5 liter magnum bottle, RBESG 2005 Grand Tasting. ABV was 10%. Intense oaky and malty aroma. Flavour is also intensely oaky and moderately sweet.

Abbaye Des Rocs Grand Cru Belgian Special Brown,"Lable has changed, it's now more text + subtle pared back indigo blue graphics on white than that pictured in the headers. ABV is marked as 9.5% instead of the 9.0% in the headers. 
Front lable reads: 'Brasserie Des Rocs, Grand Cru, Belgian Special Brown Ale'. 
L- Pours very rich intense chestnut brown, clear, though I see now some minor sediment was left in the bottle. 3mm pale tan head. 
S- Pungent deep roasted fruits. Reminds me of British Xmas pudding. This is a good sign IME touch wood. 
T- The Smell follows into the Taste, plus a little more somewhat dry and toasty edge on top. Perhaps that's what differentiates this from a Belgian tripel, which at this ABV% I'd expect to be much richer. 
F- Pungent, quite a hefty feel. Somewhat dry for a 9.5% though, I notice in the subtle little lick of hoppy zing I get on my tongue/palate as I swallow. I think it's cleverly balanced.  
O- Nice. It has a power and one that is quite reined in for 9.5% Nothing leaps out and beats you over the head. Nothing at all strikes me as at all out of balance. Very drinkable and I'd happily drink it again. This style would work best for me in colder months.... visions of kicking back and slow-sipping a couple of these in front of a log fire that maybe one day I'll own :)

Abbaye Des Rocs Grand Cru Belgian Special Brown,"Pours a hazelnut brown color with a huge, stable eggshell colored head. 
 
Smells of milk chocolate, green peppers, allspice and anise. Quite forward on the spices, this manages to establish a balancing herbal hop presence on the nose, providing an intriguing depth. 
 
Has a soft, medium bodied mouthfeel with a fitting, lighter effervescence during its finish. 
 
Has a soft, almost aqueous beginning, followed up by bakers chocolate, cardamom and glazed toffee, together with a light note of dried leaves. Those produce a pleasant dryness, feathering the overall malt sweetness in this a bit, allowing for spicy licorice and a whiff of milk chocolate to cut through. Finishes with even more spicy, chewy licorice and sweeter turning chocolate among rock sugar and very light noble hops.

Taste: Light fruity esters led by apple dance quickly on the palate before being hit with a huge wave of malt flavors.

Pours a hazy strawberry red color with a fairly large fizzy pink head that dissipates quickly down to nothing. Carbonation appears huge. Aromas of berry jam, pale malts, subtle funk, tart red fruits including of course cherry but also strawberry. There’s a uniqueness to the aroma that differentiates it’s from most lambic, perhaps a product of the blending as it appears this is not 100% lambic but a blend with some other base beer. Regardless i really did the aroma. Taste is much more sour than the aroma implied. Balanced by the big berry notes. some oak, only funk is the burnt plastic kind there’s almost no pungent character which I prefer. Mouthfeel is a bit harsh, it’s just so heavily carbonated it’s almost hard to drink without belching or getting hiccups. Never had that happen with a beer before. This also somewhat limits it’s drinkability. Overall, quite a nice beer, but lacking when compared to some of the greatest Belgium lambic.

Ayinger Weizenbock,"Well the back label unfortunately fell off of this one, so the bottling date is unknown. At least it’s a Weizenbock so even if it’s older it’s probably holding up pretty well. It’s always fun to try this style since you rarely see them, and this is one of the classic examples. Let’s crack it open 
 
Pours a cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing 
 
The nose here is very bright, yet gentle at the same time. I’m picking up on aromas of orange zest, sweet homey, bready malt, overripe banana, clove, toasted grain, floral hops, toffee, and bubblegum 
 
In taste it seems more raw and unrefined, leaning hard into the phenols. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting bready malt, sweet honey, clove, burnt sugar, bubblegum, earthy wheat, peppery hops, and light banana. The swallow brings notes of clove, banana bread, sweet honey, toffee, orange zest, black pepper, light toast, and earthy wheat 
 
A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a creamy beer. Finishes neutral and balanced

Abbaye Des Rocs [Brasserie Des Rocs Brune],"L- Deep chestnut, and has poured beyond hazy, this has small chunks floating around despite the bottle being rested for days and poured reeeally slowly - so it seems pretty major sediment is inevitable/by design. Pours with 5mm off white head, half of which still exists when I finish the glass 15mins later. 
S- Milder than anticipated, some caramel and a sense of richness. I thought I got a hint of mild/sour cherry on an early sniff, but never managed to get it again. 
T- There is a small dose of sourness on the front here, then the flavour opens out immediately - boom! It's big, pungent and deep. It has a sweet note (in parallel with it's overall richness), something I rarely favour but here it's balanced by the sour. It's deep well-roasted pungency make this a super winter-warmer type of beer. ps Late on I suddenly get a 'Hang on, is that a blackcurrent note coming in!?'... maybe, fleeting. 
F- It's quite a mouthful, pungent, intense, more suited to colder months as a slow-sippin' winter warmer beer. All rather wonderful. 
O- I think this is absolutely superb. How they balance the sweet + sour is very clever, it's so fine-tuned. Overall the whole hangs together really well; there isn't anything at all that I note that's 'wrong', or out of balance.

The appearance was a ruddy burnt amber bronze color with a level foamy white head slowly dissipating to leave some wispy messy lace. 
The aroma seemed to lead with a blend that reminded me of ""honeydew coated biscuits."" Some light dry citrus rind underneath with an ever so slight whiff of clean laundry. Some floral hops lean in further underneath. 
The flavor dryly took the sweetness and met it with an ample bitterness. Mellow aftertaste of biscuit malts, floral hops, and some honeydew. 
The mouthfeel was about medium bodied with a fair sipping quality about it. The ABV might be high in this one but it seems like the brewer was able to combine well enough to not let the ABV ""overtake"" in any sort of way. Some smoothness running along my tongue. Carbonation felt good like a West coast styled DIPA. Finishes with some malty sweetness but slightly sticky and dry, floral hop bitterness.

Has a white head that's about an inch thick when first poured that settles eventually to very thick layer of surface foam, a thick ring lining the inside of the glass, and excellent lacing. Aromas of some bready malts w/ a bit of caramel, along w/ piney, floral, and citrus hop notes. Flavors of the aforementioned bready, slightly zest, malts w/ a nice bit of caramel sweetness gives way to the also aforementioned piney, floral, and citrus hop that provide the perfect amount of bitterness, While there is a good amount of malts, the hope certainly dominate the flavor profile here. Which is as it should be. Has a Has a crisp, slightly oily, smooth, medium to full bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Has a clean finish and a nice after taste. Easy to drink in the good way a well crafted IPA ought to be.

IPA,"Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Canned August 2nd 2022. Pushing it here for freshness but at least it was in the cold case. 
 
Beautiful looking IPA. Deep amber bodied, with crystal copper colors and light appearances of carbonation. Off white head, definitely near the khaki yellow colored realm with simple classic three to four finger height. Lots of staying power, barely budging at all with massive retention. Just a great looking bold ipa. 
 
Unfortunately hints of classic faded hops on the nose, with a soft caramel dominating and leafy touches of herbs, if a bit small on the nose. Still there's a nice floral pungency here, if understated. 
 
Palate seems fairly old school. Touches of leafy sage like herbal hops, with a big emphasis on tea green flavors. Finish with soft caramel and more leafy like tea flavors and mild senses of bitterness. Mild touches of pine and earth in the finish. 
 
Decent, but I think I might have missed the boat on this one. This definitely needs a revisit from me in the fresh future cause there is some quality in here.",3.82

Pours clear coppery amber with a big head and a little bit of visible carbonation. Smell is classic west coast, grapefruit rind and cut vegetation, maybe a little honeysuckle thrown in there for good measure.

There’s a good oude bruin in there somewhere but it’s buried under a ton of cherry.  
That’s good news for anyone who can’t handle the tartness, but for anyone else, there’s something getting lost. (If it was a Flanders Red, maybe I could see this much fruit…) 
There’s some wood and only the vaguest funk after 7 years, and the wine serves to double up those cherries.

The Dissident,"*2019 Reserve with Cherries, 10.5% ABV 
Look: A fairly clear and light cherry red with a minimal head that suds up quickly and rapidly dissipates to only a ring of film encircling the beer and leaving no lacing behind 
Aroma: I could smell it on the pour. Tart pie cherries, oak barrels, lactic acid notes, ripe dark (Bing, etc.) cherries, wood tannins reminiscent of a Cabernet Sauvignon or similar red wine, and wafts of some funky barnyard-like notes 
Taste: Ripe dark cherries hit the palate first as layers of woody oak quickly join in the mingle with the cherry. For a split second those notes hold before the quickly building acidity crescendos and as it does, wet straw, some leather, and barnyard notes become evident and hold center stage until cherries reclaim the spotlight and lead to a very tart, spritzy, and acidic finish with zero detectable alcohol heat 
Mouthfeel: Light but full, very clean throughout, looks low but drinks like it’s medium to highly carbonated, and wonderfully dry on the finish 
Overall: Wow, this is straight up blowing my mind right now and in a very good way. My sister-in-law gifted this gem to me for my b-day and I’d only had it one other time in my life – 2008, when these folks first made it and my palate being much more developed now, I can appreciate how good it is. It’s like a fine, bold red wine meets tart and dark cherry juice, meets Orval – super complex, lots of cherry and oak, some funk, spritzy like a champagne (though not that much so), and absolutely no way to tell that it’s 10.5% ABV. Phenomenal and highly recommended for any Oud Bruin fan out there",4.34
The Dissident,"This is a 2016. Five full years in the cellar have worked magic with this exceptional ale. Too bad I don’t have a fresh one right now to try it against - the difference is phenomenal. Super smooth and mellow, much less sour but a bit more funky, more juicy dark fruit.",4.36
The Dissident,"A 1 pint 6 fl. oz. waxed bomber, 2015 Reserve, with a best after date of 30th October 2016. Poured into a Holy Mountain tulip glass. 
 
Appearance: A mostly clear amber brown colour with a one finger beige head that had decent retention and left some nice lacing. 
 
Aroma: Tart, cherry, vinous, light acetone, oak, caramel notes, and a touch of vinegar. 
 
Taste: Lightly sour and tart, cherry, red grape, plum, vinous, oak, caramel, light boozy. 
 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. 
 
Overall: ABV was higher than expected, although the waxed bottle probably should have hinted in that direction. There was a slight boozy feel, but despite that it was still smooth, enjoyable and easy to drink.",4.04
The Dissident,"Four year old bottle. 
 
Nearly flat beer, murky brownish color. 
 
Wonderful nose: moderately sour, with tons of oak, vinegar, tannins, lemon, and cherry. 
 
Flavor follows, although it shows the age and oxidation much more than the nose (surprising, perhaps, given that part of the mystique around a wax cap is that it should help prevent oxidation). Flavor profile is otherwise the same as the nose, along with notes of peach and leather. 
 
Unbelievably drinkable for the high ABV; it drinks like a sour at 50-75% of the ABV.",4.13

Looks interesting in the glass. Deep, deep, hazy amber body with good carbonation replenishing a creamy, foamy slightly off white head. This head persists throughout, impressive given the abv. Layers of lacing. 
 
Aroma of tart cherry, a little wine, some wood. Manages to smell sour. 
 
On tasting, the sour and tart notes bounce off each other, making for a pleasing blend. Cherries are evident, but not strong or luscious. A little apple at times. It's warm, but the abv seems less than advertised. 
 
Mouth between medium and full. Finish is a mouth puckering tart and sour mix, with a cherry presence. 
 
Overall, one of the better sours I've had. Sour and tart mix sits very nicely on this palate.",4.21
The Dissident,"Pours a lightish red colour with a medium tan head and left quite a bit of lacing on my glass. 
 
Smells of cherry, oak barrel, some light ethanol, and kind of like a sour vinegar smell. 
 
Taste follows the nose but is even better. Lots of tart cherry and general dark fruit character. Booziness is less pronounced. There's this nice light funk present from start to finish that's more toned down than the brett version but quite pleasant. Alcohol still comes through more than I'd like but It's not terrible. The tartness balances the sweetness and the malt character really ties everything together 
 
Mouthfeel is medium-full with lots of grippy tannins.  
 
Edit: I came back to this a year after my first taste and, now that my palette has developed a bit, I love this one more than ever. Absolute must try! I'm surprised that I think this was worth the money since it's on the pricier side, but this is definitely going in my regular rotation.",4.5

Pumpkin Ale,"Golden flash of a head on a dark caramel body. A proper pumpkin pie smell emanates from this one. It tastes sweet in a lactose lite sense, with a flavorful pumpkin body and just the right mix of spices. No bitterness, and not cloying either. Sessionable in a way, but also as heavy as it should be. 8% but not detectably boozy. One other thing I like about this beer is that it is objectively a pumpkin beer. Other styles moreso mimic strong ales, barleywines, stouts, etc. But this one is simply a fine pumpkin ale and one of the best representatives of the style as it basically what you could ever want and hope for in a pumpkin beer. And the fact that the mash itself is majority pumpkin as a historical basis for the brew makes it very proper indeed.",4.39

Pumpkin Ale,"The Saint Louis Brewery, LLC ""Pumpkin Ale"" 
12 fl. oz. brown glass bottle ""BOTTLED WITH LOVE: 06/21/2022 14:09"". Sampled on 10/11/2022. 
 
Notes via stream of consciousness: This is brewed with real pumpkin and spices, and it clocks in at a solid 8% ABV. Why not? If you're going to make a pumpkin or spiced ale that someone's probably only going to drink one of why not go big? It's poured a hazy reddish chestnut brown colored body with golden highlights beneath a short head of tan foam. Sugary cinnamon greets you in the nose backed by a light apple-like fruitiness. The flavor follows and it tastes like cinnamon-spiced apple cider. Beyond that there's a bready and lightly caramelish malt base and notes of nutmeg and clove. It's moderately bitter, and it finishes with a dollop of sweet malt fading to leave behind some spice that's mainly clove at this point. In the mouth it's medium bodied and smooth with a moderate, fine-bubbled carbonation. The head retention and lacing could both be better but for a spiced beer of 8% it's not bad. It's not over-spiced, over-done in maltiness or body or alcohol, and really well-balanced across the board. It's really nicely done and although I suggested that spiced ales are generally a one and done kind of beer I truly believe that you could enjoy two, or maybe even three of these in a row.

Aphrodisiaque / Aphrodite,"This is my new favourite stout among those that I can buy in my region. At $14 for 4 bottles it's so much better than I would have expected. 
The look is pretty standard for a 7% ish abv stout. Dark black with brownish head that leaves a small amount of lacing. 
The smell on this beer is great I didn't have a bottle opener when I tried it for the first time so I had to whack it on the counter and when some spilled there was this huge rush of vanilla, chocolate, and beautiful malt.  
The taste does not quite follow the nose. The complex profile on the nose is lessened significantly when tasting. It is still very cool and the added flavours of vanilla and chocolate are done well enough. The vanilla comes up front but is subtle and the sweetness is balanced well by the roasted malt. The chocolate follows into the aftertaste and is again balanced well by the bitter coffee notes of the roasted malt.

Vintage Ale,"2021 Vintage, bottle #139563.... 
 
A- Pours a lovely orange hued dark bronze color, is semi opaque, and the head, which is about two fingers thick, shows a shade of creamy white with toffee infusion. The carbonation appears to be somewhat mellow, with only a few columns slumbering there way upward, with the lacing showing rather well and stickily. I am being painted a grouping of cave art like animals around the inside of the glass....very nice looking overall! 
 
S- Heavy malt profile here, with plenty of caramel/toffee sweetness, dark fruit flesh, such as plum and fig richness, various citrus nuances (tangerine, blood orange, grapefruit, pomello), and a sweet alcoholic nature, of rum soaked raisins. The finish has some interesting fruity bitter hops, which would explain what I read about the experimental CF182 variety being used here....I even detect some pineapple tropical like aromas on the end! 
 
T- Very well balanced overall, with a wonderful blend of toffee/caramel malt sweetness, rummy raisin/plum/fig richness, slight orchard fruitiness. After I get through all of this, my palate is hit once again by a second round of malt bomb....full of sweet cooked brown sugar, dark toffee, molasses, sugarcane, and dulce de leche. The finish showcases some very British flavors found in traditional pale ales.....zesty citrus peel, tropical fruitiness and dry leafy herbal tones, quenching the palate and leading me on to want more! 
 
M/O- I,ve enjoyed aged vintages from Fullers before and this is the first time I've had one right after release....I have to say that I am impressed with the overall flavors and richness for something so ""fresh"". The carbonation is smooth and allows the full flavors to release onto the palate gently, while the body is somewhere in the medium-full range. The alcohol is incredibly well hidden and soft for an 8.5% brew, but I don't believe this would be something with a high drinkability factor....one is plenty in a sitting. I appreciate the usage of experimental hops and the attempt to create something unique, which I think fits the bill here.....overall this is an exceptional English style Pale Ale, and would become a great Old Ale after several years of aging!",4.5

While it may be mildly unfair for me to rate this 2010 bottle straight up, it's clearly intended for extensive aging, which I don't feel caused it much detriment anyway. 
 
That said, it exhibits distinct characteristics of grape and prune, and as such lands well within the intended range of emulating wine. These characteristics are accented by softly light notes of pumpernickel and melba toast before exhaling floral tobacco. 
 
The body is smoothly slick with a lightly soft carbonation that fines out into a faintly tingling, slightly numbing, semi-dry finish. Over time, that leafy, floral tobacco verges into cigar skin to delicately dry the palate out further.",4.24

Nice traditional and luxurious packaging, nice collectible bottle. Pours a lovely deep mahogany, slightly hazy, with two smooth fingers of off-white, beige-tinged head that recede slowly, and shockingly stick around for the entire pint despite the 8.5% alcohol content, which took me over 20 minutes to finish. The smell whollops you over the head with fruits like blackberry and plum. Ethanol is present but far from obtrusive. The dark fruit profile carries forward into the taste, complemented by marmalade, chocolate notes, subtle caramel, and even subtler earthy, zesty hops. The mouthfeel is smooth as silk, the ethanol noticeable - at 8.5% there's no way around that - but incorporated into the flavour profile. Overall, a delicious, complex, smooth, and very special beer.",4.76

Appearance - Pours hazy and burnt amber in color. Sandstone colored, finger width head that holds for a minute or so before scaling down to a thin, broken layer of suds on the surface, thickening up around the edge of the glass. Fair lacing, with some streaky lines and small spots making up most of it.  
 
Smell - Raisin and toffee upfront, with some caramel, oak, nutty character and some booze.  
 
Taste - Follows the nose. Toffee and raisin hit the palate first, with lesser caramel, oak and maybe even a hint of chocolate mid-taste. Finish adds some mild, acidic, booze and a bit of almond, reminiscent of sherry, and the aftertaste is a nice, easy blend of the aforementioned flavors easing out slowly.  
 
Mouthfeel - Light-to-medium in body with low carbonation. Drinks smooth enough, though does seem a bit thin. Perhaps due to the 7 years of age it's been afforded.  
 
Overall - Nice old ale. It doesn't quite do it for me like North Coast Old Stock, which is more full-bodied and flavored, but it does have some similar qualities. I wouldn't mind trying this fresh, or with a few years of age on it, though it looks like they change up the hop profile every year.",4.08

Cuvee De Tomme,"A corked and caged 1 pint 9.4 fl. oz. bottle with no clear bottled on or best before date. Poured into a Tilquin stemmed glass. 
 
Appearance: It was a dark brownish red colour, with a thin beige head that dissipated quickly, while leaving only sparse to no lacing. 
 
Aroma: Cherry, vanilla, blackcurrant, oak, graphite, cabernet sauvignon. 
 
Taste: Sour, tart, cherry, blackcurrant, blackberry, vanilla, oak, with light notes of caramel, chocolate and bourbon, and a lightly acidic finish. 
 
Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied with soft carbonation. 
 
Overall: Complex and enjoyable. Loved the aroma, while the taste was good but perhaps just a touch acidic.",4.55

Pours a brownish ruby color, semi opaque, with no head and no lacing. Aromas of cherry, wine, oak, some chocolate, light caramel. Smells lightly sour. Flavors are similar- cherry, wine, oak, malt, some chocolate, light caramel. Tastes fairly sour and lightly tart. Smooth, a solid medium body, appropriately carbonated on the low side.  
 
Very enjoyable. Lots of cherry, more sour than expected after about five years, didn’t pick up the bourbon barrels at all. Based on the description above, I would say that some of the flavors have become less distinct.",4.24

S: tart cherry, sour brown ale maltiness, dark fruit and perfumy undertones... excellent intensity and depth

Aroma: Strong aromas of bread and spice upfront. There is bread, cloves, and Belgian spices. Some coriander and banana before a bready and banana malt backbone.  
 
Flavor: Strong flavors upfront of sweet bread and bananas. There's cloves and spices. Prominent bread malts with yeast and clove spices on the finish.

Dancing Man,"L: Pours a beautifully cloudy burnished amber, and even with a fairly careful pour, formed a four-finger head of dense off-white foam. Plenty of tiny bubbles visible racing from the bottom. 
 
S: A delightful bouquet of ripe wheat, bubblegum, clove, and white grape. 
 
T: At the risk of redundant repetition, ""delightful"" seems again apropos. Each sip opens with a lovely slurry of clove and banana flavor, with some pear and white grape notes developing as it moves across the tongue. By the swallow, some light citrusy coriander tones join in, and linger alongside the clove for the aftertaste. 
 
F: That is as lush and pillowy as one could want a wheat beer to feel. The phrase ""cream of what"" came to mind as a descriptor for this brew's mouthfeel.

Dancing Man,"Bottle reads 'E221'; consumed on 3/26/21 
 
Pours a lightly hazed copper-tinted golden body sporting a rangy effervescence and capped with two fingers of rocky, fluffy, white foam; good head retention leaves a thin layer of craggy cap, a thick, frothy collar, and broad, uniform webs of lacing holding firmly to the walls of the glass. 
 
Aroma brings charry bubblegum and firm, almost mineralic, yeasty spice opening with a distant waft of stone fruit underlying; earthy clove over the middle and subtle banana expanding from a background position across the olfactories is established and direct, while sweeter clove evolves to close the bouquet. 
 
Taste offers peppery spice and raw clove upfront into subdued yeasty characteristics persisting over the mid-palate toward a decidedly wheaty back end, where tinges of earth, flaked malts, and a slight minerality phase into a wisp of booziness sneaking through the finish. 
 
Mouthfeel shows a light body along with a fluffy puff of airy carbonation phasing easily to a crisp, wavering consistency appealing to a slightly thinning, quenching lightness on the palate, eventually firming up on the back end as a taut, flaky textures finishes. 
 
While an assertive profile accentuates some classic stylistic touches alongside a slightly more modern, earthy twist, the booziness remains somewhat apparent across this higher-octane Hefeweizen.",3.84
Dancing Man,"12oz bottle. Etched at bottom edge of bottle is '0203260043738'. 
Slightly cloudy, deep gold colored body. Bit of a gusher upon removing the cap. Two fingers of high head after pouring. Big burst of effervescence following the pour. Leaves behind a few spots of foam. 
Aroma of banana and bit of cloves and cinnamon. 
Taste of banana and spices, along with the sharp wheat note. A touch of both sweet and spicy. A flavor of green apple comes in at the end. The yeast esters continue into the aftertaste. 
Medium for mouth feel and for smoothness. The higher ABV% delivers a bite. Quiet in the mouth, with minimal carbonation. 
Easy to drink because of the low carbonation feel in the mouth, and the slight dryness that calls for another quaff.",4.24

Just Outstanding IPA,,3.62
Just Outstanding IPA,"Getting back to basics, the American IPA has never celebrated bitterness better than in its West Coast varieties. Kern River's take on the sub-style is just bitter, just dry, just clean and just refreshing. All in all, it's just outstanding! 
 
So Just Outstanding IPA gets going with a bubbly pour of hazy golden and orange hues. As its frothy white cap tops the rim, the common but clean and sharp fragrance of citrus, botanicals, spruce and peppery hops create a nearly citronella character on the nose. Simple and sweet in its malt profile, the beer's early taste is redolent with lighter versions of caramel, honey, toasted nuttiness and crust in a slight granola kind of way. 
 
As the hops unfold on the middle palate, the simply blossom with citrus flavor. Branch-ripe tangerine coupled with ruby red grapefruit and the brightness of lime and a juicy impression of citrus evolve. A background of pineapple and lighter mango add a rounded fruitiness to the hops for a complex and flavorful balance. As the malt influences starts to dissolve off the tongue, the juiciness of citrus fades and its bitterness begins to take its place, providing strong impressions of pine sap, fruit peels, peppery grasses and herbs and an overall botanical gin-like counterpart once the alcohol flavors arrive. 
 
Medium bodied and trending lighter, dry, crisp and highly refreshing, the relatively error-free IPA is a remarkably brewed IPA that's a standout in a crowded IPA market. Finishing snappy and lingering with bitterness, the session concludes with a comforting hop bite.",4.25
Just Outstanding IPA,"16 ounce can into plastic cup in my Orange Tustin Hotel room. Canned on 2/11/22. Pours very hazy golden amber/light orange color with a 1 finger dense and creamy off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lasts. Dense soapy lacing down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas and flavors of big red grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, apricot, mango, honeydew melon, passion fruit, berries, citrus peel/rind, wood, pepper, pine, wheat, bread dough, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Light-medium pine, citrus peel/rind, herbal, floral, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body. Creamy/bready malts, some sticky hops, and light resins in the mouthfeel. Soft finish with lingering resin dryness and no hop astringency. Minimal warming 6.8% or hop burn after the finish. Amazing Simcoe and Amarillo profile. Super juicy hops with some dank and earthy notes, and a soft hazy malt backbone. Loved the hop profile as expected.",4.4

A little more than medium-bodied. Very drinkable.",4.41
Weihenstephaner Korbinian,,4.25
Weihenstephaner Korbinian,"Appearance: Poured with barely a feather's worth of head that dissipated immediately. The body though, deep, dark rich brown when held to the light shows thin but steady carbonation. 
 
Smell: Predominantly caramel malt, but with notes of toffee and a fruit backbone as plum, molasses and maybe a hint of pumpernickel bread is present. Needs a bit warming, but still decently potent upon pour. 
 
Taste: Rich, rich malt as caramel, toffee, plum and molasses start us off, that sugary molasses permeates the beer as notes of raisins, nut and I think even a mild rum note come in before we end on a fairly non-descript slight bitter note. That ending is really the only thing holding back the perfect score and that it is just a little bit too rich. Still decadent. 
 
Mouthfeel: Aftertaste is a next mix of malt, molasses and rum raisin. Carbonation is a bit too low for my liking, as I think some creaminess could add something to this. The transitioning is wonderful, as it shifts seamlessly. 
 
Drinkability: The body is certainly on the thicker side of medium body, but the low carbonation here means it settles down incredibly well. It doesn't quite disguise its ABV with that Rum note, and it certainly pushes it's weight around, but it does it in a good way. 
 
Final Thoughts: I love Weihenstephaner, ironically the only thing they brew that I wouldn't say is exceptional (but is still solid) is their standard Hefeweizen, which is what they are probably most known for. This to me shows, they don't necessarily need to stick to wheat to produce something awesome. You really can't go wrong with this brewer.",4.22
Weihenstephaner Korbinian,"Pours a dark, caramel color and has looks to have lots of carbonation by the bubbles during the pour. The head is foamy, but subsides quickly.  
 
The smell is amazing. Similar to caramel, but there is a distinct smell that is fainly fruity. It almost smells like sugary, baked apples. There is a slight booziness. 
 
The flavor is great. If you can stomach a bit of booziness, there is rich, malty flavor. Like caramel, toffee, and toasted bread. Very low in bitterness, and not overly sweet. There is a tinge of coffee/toffee in the aftertaste. 
 
The mouthfeel isn't particularly thick or particularly syrupy. It has a good, malty balance.  
 
An exceptional beer overall. One of my favorites.",4.62

Yet another bottle I grabbed when me and my buddy did the cellar tour there last month. On paper, red wine barrel aging and mixed fermentation is everything I want in a Saison, but this is a style for me that needs to do a lot to impress me. That being said, I trust Allagash to deliver though, so I’m excited to try it 
 
Pours a slightly cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of off white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing 
 
There’s really not too much funk in the nose, but the earthy vibe is still keeping me intrigued. I’m picking up on aromas of bready malt, tannic red wine, wildflower honey, stone, wet hay, lemon yogurt, light earthy hops, and pear skin 
 
It’s sharper up front in taste which I appreciate, but returns to the yeasty vibe on the back end. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting tart red grape, lemon juice, doughy malt, earthy wheat, sharp oak, honey, tart plum, and pear skin. The swallow brings notes of earthy wheat, wildflower honey, lemon yogurt, stone, wet hay, bready malt, and tannic red wine 
 
A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a tannic and beer. Finishes dry with a great balance

Interlude,"What is this, a double saison? 10.4% and a 4.24 average, this outta be interesting.  
 
Pours a darker color than almost any saison, guessing this took some barrel notes with it to the extent that it literally turned the saison beer darker. Or maybe its just a maltyboi. Or both. Anyways, its this mixture of dark amber and brown. Not much for head retention, maybe 1/4"" white at its peak, but really settles a lot less than that. The aroma had more of a belgian quad than it did saison vibe. But there was a bit of fruitcake like breadiness in the nose, seems this one has an ample amount of brett character/nose.  
 
Taste brings all the dark fruit in the world into a beer with no dark fruit, no doubt the wine barrel brings a lot of that, but also this belgian yeast that doesn't seem like a saison yeast at all (more qua, bspa or bdsa). Mouth feel has a grip load of alcohol heat to it, not something I want in a 'saison'. But this isn't much of a saison, its more like a wine barrel aged quad.

La Chouffe (Blonde),"Re-reviewing as the last review I wrote was after at about 5 bottles of various triples and quadruples, and I was pretty much only seeing pink elephants and elfs. And devils. And satans. And lucifers. Is the devil and satan the same? And also Lucifer? No, Lucifer is different from the devil.  
 
Bought from my Casino supermarket, in Paris. 
 
There is an elf thing on the bottle. Maybe Chouffe is an elf..? Not sure... 
 
Nice look. 
 
In glass, loving it. Deep, red, amber colour. Nice level of head. 
 
Aroma has elements of Duvel, though much more carbon dioxidy, and less apricot fruitness. It seems very heavy, without enough hops to balance the heavyness. 
 
Taste certainly draws some parallels with Duvel and Delirium Tremens. For me this is nowhere near as well mastered to the same level. Flavours are less intense, and there is a distinct carbon dioxide/fizzy water flavour. Citrus is quite prominent. Mainly lemon peel and tangerine. 
 
Coriander is listed in the ingredients, I also faintly taste peach, though overall it's balance of flavours is not up there with the best Belgian triples. As the carbon dioxide bubbles disappear, the taste improves. 
 
I have to disagree with the Bros giving it 99. Going to have a Duvel now to compare. Yes, Duvel is far superior.  
 
Try them together, there is much difference... 
 
Probably the most over-rated beer on this site in my opinion. Please try the Chouffe IPA. That is so much better, and one of my favourite commercially available beers ever. This has too much maltiness...it really needs the extra hops. Duvel and Delirium Tremens are naturally better balanced. Without the coriander, this would not taste of much at all. And adding coriander is cheating in my opinion. Only hops and cannabis should be allowed, in addition to malt and sugar. And water, obviously.",3.15

The taste is bright, but definitely sweet. It's quite sweet, kind of honey sweet. The fruity melange is very flavorful mid-taste. Lots of green apple, a banana I missed in the nose, melon, pear. Grassy herbaceous hops, but not too much. The aftertaste is a big hit with me - quite peppery, a kiss of coriander, pleasant phenolic. Belgian yeast goodness with a deft overlay of hoppiness. 
 
It's very dry, fairly lively carbonation. Aftertaste sneaks up then there's a wallop of peppery spice, some coriander, and Fruity bubblegum aromatics without the nonsense that comes with bubblegum - maybe more like Juicy Fruit. Apple revisits in the aftertaste as well. 
 
This is some good stuff right here. Glad I grabbed the single, which are pretty scarce given the wrap-around cardboard four packs.",4.33

Apex,"August 16th, 2016 - Bear Republic's Apex predator is a trip to Glacier National Park in the glass. It panders to the bear theme, but also offers some good citrus pine notes, plus the decidedly NOT Park-like pineapple note. I also get tastes of raw tomato and watermelon. The flavor is milder and tickler than the aroma implies, with a stickiness, some dank touches, ginger and orange candies.

Racer X Double IPA,"BB: 04/11/21 
Consumed: 02/02/21 
 
L: Pours a pale to medium amber with a medium chill haze. An aggressive pour yields a nice off-white 2 fingers of head. It has ok retention, but what's left is sticky and leaves nice webs of lacing as the beer recedes in the glass. 
 
S: Citrus rind (grapefruit?), Citrus pulp (orange?), a bit of pine, and prominent caramel malt.  
 
T: This is a hop bomb all right! I get blood orange on the front end flowing into the mid palate where it mixes with sweet caramel malt and sweet Valencia orange. The caramel malt continues and mixes with waves of pine resin bitterness on the finish. At first blush the sweetness is being balanced very well by the bitter finish, but as the beer warms the sweetness starts to win. 
 
F: Medium-full body with medium-light carbonation. The mouthfeel is creamy and a bit sticky with a dry finish. 
 
O: This beer takes a bat made entirely of hops and smacks you in the face while simultaneously shanking you with a sharp malt shiv....old school to say the least. To me it is actually closer to some of the proto-NEIPAs or what we used to call East-coast IPAs; i.e. a nice strong bitterness, moderately sweet, and a nice dry finish. To me, though, this is a bit sweeter than an East-coast IPA. As the beer warms it becomes a bit more unbalanced as the sweetness starts to become more prominent in both the nose and palate. For me that detracts from the palate more so than the nose and it loses .25 to .5 in the taste column as a result. As it warms it is not as balanced as it's younger sibling. Either way, this is a great IPA and a safe harbor in a ""Locust Reign"" of NEIPAs. You should try it if you get a chance.",4.25

S: Balanced aroma of caramel malts and citrusy hops. Simple and classic.  
 
T: The taste takes me straight back to my formative years as a craft beer drinker, massaging both hops and malt into a perfectly balanced, thoroughly assertive river of flavor. Grapefruit, pine, caramel, and biscuit are all present in equal measure, with everything wrapping up in a solidly bitter, resinous finish with just enough lingering caramel to keep things smooth. Delicious.  
 
F: On the full side of medium-bodied with ample, velvety carbonation. Sticky in a good way.

Kriek Ale,"2017 from the bottle... 
 
A deep dried blood red with auburn and chestnut highlights bordering the clean body towards the browner side of the spectrum. It would be still looking if it weren't for the few rising bubbles hopelessly devoted to supporting some kind of cap above, but a failed attempt nonetheless. 
 
Sweet and sour cherries clearly and proudly display themselves front and center with a mouthwatering acidity. Deep red wine, oak barrel and all shine from withing. A touch of pepper and damp mulch linger in the end. 
 
Wow, this thing tastes like straight sour grape and cherry Fun Dip. I think the puckering powdery tartness not only exemplifies the feel, but must be considered a flavor to this beast as well. As it warms, oak certainly comes through along with a boysenberry sweetness. 
 
Feel?... See above. Add some strong tannins, an initial slickness, a wood stripping acidic drying tartness,and almost no carbonation, and viola. There you have it. 
 
This is a sour to compete with the most of sours. Delicious, well executed, but so friggin intense like most of the offerings I've had the pleasure of enjoying. Certainly not for the faint of heart.

Imperial Stout Trooper,"Canned December 14, 2017 with the bottom of the can stamped ""Vulcans 4 Life"" 
 
Ok...let's see how this ~6 year old beer has held up. Appearance wise, the answer is, quite well. Stouts almost all look the same to me, but that's not a bad thing. Deepest brown / black, but what I was pleasantly surprised with was the thick, beige head that showed good retention before settling into a permanent ring and cap.  
 
Aroma is a nice blend of roast and sweetness. Cocoa, roasted malts and vanilla-like aromas. Nice smelling beer.  
 
Taste is where the age of the beer is showing up. I think time has likely stripped away what I imagine were a more congruous set of ingredients. What's left is a little bit like bitter cocoa mixed into a thin base beer.  
 
Overall, this is not particularly enjoyable. I will have to try it fresh. Certainly can't blame the brewer for the fact that this languished in my cellar for way too long.",3.45
Imperial Stout Trooper,"Pours a dark cola color and settles as black in the glass with a dense dark tan head. The nose includes a nice amount of rich cocoa, along with roasty char notes and a bit of stone fruit. 
 
The taste is amped up, with that rich cocoa and roasty char syncing nicely with the dark cherry flavor to present a really flavorful imperial stout that improves as it warms.

Strong roast at the front of the nose, yet it didn't border on coffee. Solid malts, and a light bit of chocolate were behind the roast. 
 
Similar on the tongue, with the roast coming across a bit stronger, and lingering on the finish.

Courage Imperial Russian Stout,"1993 vintage 
 
Happy New Year BA!! This beer is officially 30 years old, and I can’t think of a better occasion to crack it open. I picked this one up from OEC in late 2021 who had been cellaring it since 2004, so even for being 30 years old it’s probably kept in pretty good condition over the years. Let’s see how the oldest beer I’ve ever had is 
 
Pours still and slightly cloudy dark reddish brown, no head or lacing to be found 
 
Honestly on smell alone, you could tell me this is only about 15 years old and I’d believe you. Definitely oxidized, but I was expecting much worse. I’m picking up on aromas of prune, burnt caramel, port wine, cacao nib, black licorice, molasses, acrid coffee, and a touch of soy sauce 
 
It definitely shows its age much more in taste, but it's honestly better than I expected going into it and is still just as enjoyable as the aroma suggested. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting black cherry, oxidized sherry, caramel, light coffee, fig, and molasses. The swallow brings notes of black cherry, port wine, soy sauce, molasses, acrid coffee, cocoa powder, light prune, and burnt caramel 
 
A medium body and no carbonation results in a watery yet boozy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a significant roast 
 
I'm genuinely shocked at how much I find myself enjoying this one. I picked it up out of sheer curiosity, having a beer older than myself just seemed like a novel idea. Obviously it's well past its prime, but it still held up nicely after 30 years",3.96

B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher,"Traded a Dark Lord for one of these in like 2010? Maybe 2009 or 2011. But definitely a long time ago. This fucker has been aging. 
 
Pour is inky black but still very nicely fizzy. Wisp of a brown head. Really incredible pour, considering the strength and age. 
 
Aroma is, likewise, surprisingly bright and nice. I remember someone, in some vague context, telling me I had been hosed in the trade. I dunno. Back then I was lousy with FFF rarities. This wears its age nicely, and there's no hint that it wouldn't have been good-to-great if consumed several years earlier. Very dark chocolate and coffee, some pleasantly sharp grain. The nodes that are discernably aged mellow it out but don't overwhelm it with the sort of overripe fruit nodes that often denote staleness. 
 
Flavor is, again, surprisingly great. It tastes like a more or less fresh double stout, only wonderfully smoothed over. Aggressive but never overwhelming. Dark, dark, dark and bitter chocolate up front, bittersour grain in the middle, and a wee bitty kiss o' the hops on the finish.  
 
Maybe I'm just an aging man with atavistic pretensions. Maybe beers were just better before the market got oversaturated. I dunno. What I do know is I liked this quite a bit.",4.64

Christmas Ale,"2022 release, poured into chilled whisky chalice at 55degF. 
 
L: Pours dark, with a fine-bubbled tan head that dissipates within a minute or so 
 
S: Dark fruits, malt, caramel, banana, clove, pear 
Warmed S: Caramel and booze notes come out in full force, with fruit receding 
 
T: Surprising blood orange note mixed in with clove, allspice, caramel, with boozy notes on the end reminiscent of cognac. Continued partaking sees a buildup of ""barrel aged"" flavors. 
Warmed T: Sweet dates mix with the blood orange, spices recede somewhat 
 
F: Medium/heavy mouthfeel that coats the tongue. Definitely a sipper that can stand without a food pairing. Satisfying to the palate on its own. The texture clings in a way that layers on flavors as you continue to sip, enhancing what comes through as almost a barrel-aged taste, although without the normal acridity you get from the tannins in barrel-aged beers. There is a light hopping that would cleanse the palate if drunk with food. 
Warmed F: Coats the palate less the longer you drink, perhaps a buildup of the hops, or a thinning as the beverage warms. 
 
O: An excellent quad. Not too sweet (thank god). I wouldn't say it screams ""Christmas"" but it is a spectacular trappist offering. So glad I managed to get my hands on this beer. Feels stronger than 10% when you're near the end of it.

Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),"Drunk overlooking the ocean on the father-in-law's deck in January 2023, after having received it way back in February 2022 from @turkeysdrinkbeer. The view and the alcohol might have gotten to me, so strap in for the review... 
 
L: Pours a rusty orange-brown, with little to no head, but what does hang around is bright white. A slow, languorous stream of carbonation threads its way up the glass around lazy, suspended sediment. That the sediment is there at all is due to my inattention while pouring. The beer is 6 years old as I pour it and I should have been more on my game. That all said, the beer screams barleywine. It looks thick. It looks rich. It looks like it wants a fire and a pair of wolfhounds at my feet while I drink it.  
 
A: It smells like an old English farmhouse. There are years in the carpet, pipe tobacco in the air, coal dust by the back door, and age seeping deep into everything. There's a strong umami scent - redolent of crushed beetles, soy sauce and oxidation. There's booze and old sherry, old enough that the liquid has begun to crystalise in the bottom of the bottle. There's marmalade, thick and bursting with peel and sitting beside the jar of Marmite. This is comfort and warmth, cold nights, warm fires and old, old tweed jackets.  
 
T: First blush is sweet malt, quickly gaining an umami edge before the marmalade washes over the tongue. There's an earthy, woody bitterness that never stretches itself beyond mild, and stays away from anything resembling a new word hop. Booze follows, mild at first, building as it warms and then softens out. There's a whiskey note right at the end as the beer thins after the swallow and a nice warmth in the throat and stomach. Everything works in harmony. It's not as loud and proud as the nose, but it perfectly fits the aural scene, and the subtle differences and softening of the taste work brilliantly after the build-up.  
 
M: It's as thick as it looks in the glass. If ever a beer needed a spoon - fine old silverware, if it please m'lord - this one is it. Carbonation is an afterthought. The beer rolls over the tongue with almost no carbonic prickle and leaves only the slightest calling card on the way down.  
 
O: This beer is the perfect synergy of nose, tongue and eyes. It looks like a barleywine, smells like a barleywine and sure tastes like a barleywine. All of those elements build on each other, and it's the evocative nature of that relationship, the building of a sensory pyramid that far outstretches its foundations, that make this beer so good. It's important to understand this is an English barleywine - there are no screaming hops, no face-melting bitterness; instead, there is malt shoved proudly front and centre, and a nod to classic English condiments, lifestyles past and times slower. Drink this beer whenever you see it.  
 
Cheers!

Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),"2015 canning (8.4 oz can). Consumed at cellar temperature (~55° - guesstimate only, but a bit warmer if anything). 
 
Appearance is dark orange, toward brown, slightly hazy with sparse carbonation. Very short off-white fizzy head with near zero retention; the head is completely gone with just a thin ring before I can put the camera down, and even this ring is gone before I can take a sip, leaving a tea-like appearance. No lacing. 
 
Fruity aroma. Apple. Caramel. Toffee. Figs. Brandy. Quite nice. 
 
The taste is a bit harsh. (Perhaps a 2015 is too young?) Citrus rind. Alcohol. Tobacco. Leather. Boozy. The citrus rind harshness lends a bit of bitterness and the tobacco earthiness is not a good counterbalance. The fruitiness (other than the rind) has not made an appearance. The alcohol warms my mouth and throat in the finish and aftertaste, with the tobacco/rind lingering. 
 
Mouth feel has a moderate body and flat feel (no carbonation). 
 
Overall, vastly disappointing, especially given the reputation and price at just under $1/oz. As I noted above, perhaps more age will mellow out the harshness. I regret buying two. The other one WILL remain in the cellar for more years, both to allow it to hopefully mellow out and because it will not be at the top of my list to try again.",3.62

Piney and slightly vegetal nose with just a hint of grass (lawn first, then a little dank). There’s a vague and light sweetness, somewhat fructose but I’m not connecting it to a fruit. Taste has a more malty edge to this sweetness, but it’s balanced by a earthy/piney bitterness. Grapefruit pith evolves from this opening, and lingers for a short while before pine regains the ending. 
 
In the end, a pith and pine IPA with a not too sweet malty opening - what I enjoy in an IPA.",4.65

... aromas of wet old growth forest, butterscotch on oatmeal and candied orange wedges. Just a terrific throwback to what real IPA's used to smell like, rich in malt that stands up to intense hop terpenes and bitterness. 
The flavor is an essay in balance. Rich caramel malt complexity blends neatly into sharp pine and grass hop flavors. Tongue tweaking hop bite tries to dominate but the sweet grain character keeps it all together.  
Body is a heavy medium and the finish is slightly astringent but nicely peppery and warmly boozy.

L: Pours a deep gold with light to light-medium haze. A slightly aggressive pour produces a white 2 finger head with some slight retention.

Pours a cloudy orange gold with just a thin white cap that quickly fades to a ring and leaves no lacing, the carbonation is very visible 
 
A lot of fruit and funk dancing around in the nose. I get notes of apricot, underripe peach, lemon, horse blanket, sharp oak, sweet malt, and a small touch of tobacco, oddly enough for a beer like this 
 
The flavor evolves quite a bit throughout the sip here. What starts off smooth and balanced in sweet and sour, turns into a funky dry tartness. It starts with notes of lemon, white grape, crisp but full malt, and buttery oak that reminds me of chardonnay. The swallow brings notes of sharp oak, leather, tart and funky apricot, apple skin, vinegar, and a light floral character 
 
A light body pairs with moderate carbonation for a very refreshing drinking experience. It feels light than the abv, but finishes a touch too sticky

Chinooker'd,"Chinooker’d from Lawson’s Finest Liquids. Purchased 0n 4/1/21 for $ 5.00 (Including tax) for 16 oz can ($ 0.313/oz) from Franklin Beer, Franklin, PA. In reefer at store and stored at home at 42 degrees. Reviewed 24/1/21. 
Stamped on the bottom “CANNED ON 11/18/20”. Served at 48.9 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. Final temperature 53.2 degrees.  
Appearance – 4.25. 
First pour – Pale Straw (SRM 2), slight chill haze. Second pour is clear and produces 0.5 cm head. 
Body – Straw (SRM 3), opaque. When rear-lite, opacity is shown to be due to extremely fine suspended particles and massive amounts of near-microscopic carbonation.  
Head – Average (Maximum 3.2 cm, aggressive center pour), floral white, medium density, average retention, leaving a five to seven mm crown with a cross-cut saw blade edge, fed by effervescence, and a thin partial cap with many rocks. Inserting the thermometer causes an upwelling of tiny bubbles. 
Lacing. Good. Wide band of tiny to small bubbles with an occasional hole, like torn cheesecloth. 
Aroma – 4.5 – Burst of resinous pine when can opens, quickly weakens allowing some weak generic citrus to sneak through, no malt, no yeast.  
Flavor – 4.5 – Begins with generic citrus and resinous conifers, no malt, no yeast, slightly bitter. No alcohol (6.5 % ABV, as marked on container) taste or aroma. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Ends with a mild but resinous bitterness, sans citrus and pine, but with some malt present. 
Palate – 4 – Medium, almost watery, mouthful of soft carbonation. 
Final impression and summation: 4.25 Nicely resinous and piney IPA, reminiscent of the pre-fruity days.",4.39

Trappist Westvleteren Blond,"Pours a golden blonde color with a near crystal clear transparency. Head is two fingers of white foam, with more build up after a light swirl of the glass. This frothy, pillowy foam sits a top for a long while after the pour. There is visible sediment at the base of the bottle; however, only the first 3/4 of the bottle were poured into the glass for this review. Aroma is punchy grass, herbal, medicinal, and spicy hops with a big cut of spicy yeast just behind. This yeast comes paired with clove, apple cider, and earthy malts. It smells light, and yet thick; that is to say, the breadth of notes is pretty simple, but the depth to each note is huge. Flavor profile driven by the same characteristics. It pits resiny, herbal, grassy, spicy hops against earthy, bready malt undertones. Clove pairs with spicy yeast for a little further zest and grit. Mouth feel has a sharp effervescence, at least, initially. Effervescence bubbles down to a thin crisp texture. It has a medium thickness. Overall, really stellar depth here, while remaining easy to drink. It's on the 'easier drinking' side of the Belgium spectrum, and yet still retains a remarkable depth.

Trappist Westvleteren Blond,"Blind-tasted except for the beer's name and brewery/country, zero reviews below read (yet!)... 
L- Pale gold, it was pouring clear until some minor sediment lifted right near the end. 3Cm creamy/lumpy white foam head with some sediment left in the bottle. There is unusually vigorous ongoing small-bubble rising CO2 in the glass. Holds well and forms lacing on the way down. 
S- Classic Belgian yeast notes, lightly estery + a hint of spice. Overall a bit subtle though. 
T- Follows the smell^ but the hops are brighter and dryer than anticipated (that was my 1st sip of beer today). On swallowing the hops leave a zingy dry brush over my palate that lingers for 10+ seconds. There might also be a fruit note within it too, perhaps apple. - In one respect you could feel this is like a 'hipstered' wheat/wit/weiss beer, it has most of the latter notes but the hops are notably amped up. 
F- As above, bright, refreshing, one for a hot summers day.  
O- It's very nice and elegant, there is nothing that seems out of place or balance. - But apart from what I paid for it is it something seriously amazing, well I'm not pursuaded. I've had plenty of other similar style beers to this and this isn't *that* stand-out. So I'll rate it honestly based upon that.

Taste is (for me) dominated by cinnamon. Nuts are still there, and something comes across as milk chocolate. Molasses sweetness. I was feeling a little bit of spice on my lips and thinking it was a bit odd for cinnamon to have that much power but not be totally overwhelming for me, and then I read on the label that it contains habaneros, and that's clearly evident now that I saw it. As it's warming up, the cinnamon is becoming even more powerful.

Printed on the label “2022”. Stored at 34 degrees at home. Served at 54.6 degrees F in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 59.0 degrees F.  
Appearance – 3.75. 
First pour – Ruby Brown (SRM 24), almost opaque. 
Body – Deep Brown (SRM 30), opaque. Under direct light, same. When rear lite, shows a translucent olive at the top edge and ruby at the bottom. 
Head – None. While pouring, a five mm crescent of large bubbles appears on about a third of the circumference but quickly evaporates. 
Lacing – None. 
Aroma – 4.25 – Bourbon and barrel are the predominant aromas, no malt, no yeast, no hops, no chocolate. Oddly, no habaneros. No ethanol (13.7 % ABV as marked on the label) aroma.  
Flavor – 4.5 – The habaneros set up a nice oral burn, not too hot and lacking any vegetal flavor. Cinnamon rides in on the aftertaste. Initially no hops, malt, or yeast; light chocolate and ghostly vanilla. Slight gastric warming, but that could be from capsaicin as well as ethanol. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. 
Palate – 4 – Medium; creamy; soft carbonation. 
Final impression and summation: 4.25 Lacking both head and lacing, the appearance loses a few points. Both the flavor and aroma are quite good, with distinct hits of habaneros, cinnamon, cocoa, and even detectable vanilla, all supported by the bourbon and barrel. Very good and well worth grabbing if you run across a bottle or six. Extra points for having a lizard on the label.",4.3
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Poured from a 12.7 ounce bottle, the body is a dark cola brown. Small initial head that quickly dissipated and no lacing of consequence. 
 
Aroma is a complex mix of bourbon, cinnamon, vanilla, and chile. The habanero aroma is muted but present. 
 
Taste follows nose though the barrel is a tad sweeter than the nose. You'll need to be patient to pick up the notes of walnut and oak rising from the stout upon which this beer was made (Oil of Aphrodite). The habanero is felt in the swallow, but it's a light heat. In fairness, I love habs and you might perceive more heat. The cinnamon and cacao nibs balance the pepper and the barrel holds everything together in an unlikely tasty stout. A bit more malty char would be welcome, but that's a personal preference and not a complaint. 
 
Mouthfeel is good but not great. I'd love a bit more body in this stout. More carbonation would be welcome. 
 
Overall an outstanding stout that I interestingly found a bit better when colder than I usually drink stouts. The mix seemed more flavorful when first poured.",4.4

Tally ho! I feel like Errol Flynn in “The Seahawk” while drinking this thing. Just wow. It’s as if nothing can stop me and that I could have it all. Maybe my mind is even a bit blurred and stirred by its beauty. So much so that I think that I don’t need Olivia de Haviland because I want them all.  
 
I am lost. I am found. I am. I just am.",4.65
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"No bottling date (number on inside of cap indicates potential batch 10 or later, released in 4/2020); consumed on 12/31/21 
 
Pours a barely translucent dark honey-gold body capped with two fingers of rocky, fluffy, off-white foam; solid head retention leaves a craggy sliver of cap, a moderate, frothy collar, and a haphazard spatter of spotty/webby lacing dotted across the walls of the glass. 
 
Aromas open to green apple with waxy hints of medicinal mango as touches of straw accent saison yeast toward composted guava over the middle; moist oak meets waxy funk with hints of lemon peel into the back end for a culmination of active, oily bacteria bursting with funky fruit. 
 
Taste shows evenly dispersed lactic funk in the backdrop against a predominant waxy tropical fruit overlay lingering across the palate, with zesty lemon and oak barrel to an interlude of musty white wine tannins and a grassy back end; shades of barnyard with waxy white grape funk persist as lemon zest remains through the finish. 
 
Mouthfeel brings a medium body with ample, fluffy carbonation on the higher end of moderate; a slick, oily funk peaks to a glistening lactic tartness over the mid-palate, mild yet indomitable as a clean brightness with a hint of prickly grit disperses through the back end, leaving a predominantly clean, activated finish. 
 
A bright, funky peak reached casually and with an almost unflinching consistency, the oak is a subtle background contributor interwoven with the bacterial evolution of a ripe tannic structure; bold and unwaveringly dynamic.",4.36
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"Appearance - The beer poured an orange-gold color with a bubbly white head.  
 
Smell - The nose had pleasant citrus notes with the saison funk also apparent.  
 
Taste - My initial impression was the taste of green apples. The sour impression fit the green apple notes. The saison aspects produced a vinegary funk. Any sweetness from the beginning was cancelled by the dry finish.  
 
Mouthfeel - The carbonation gave influence to the dry finish.  
 
Overall - This is pretty much everything I want in a saison. I don’t need heartburn medicine to drink this beauty.",4.46

Black Albert,"From a bottle 08/2022 at Brick Store, Decatur, Ga. Wonderful aroma, could've just taken in the aroma and not even drank any of it and wouldv'e been great. But the powerful complex array of flavors combined with unbeatable mouthfeel for an imperial stoudt put it over the top",4.7
Black Albert,"2015 Vintage 
 
A: Poured into a snifter to a black beer which is topped by a dense and rocky finger of dark tan head which fades slowly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing 
S: Smells of dark roasted malts, bitter dark chocolate, anise, raisins, and espresso 
T: Taste is dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, hints of oxidation, some slight smoke and charred wood with a hint of burnt sugars. On the swallow there's some sweetness along with more coffee, chocolate, charred wood and burnt sugar 
M: This beer is thick and velvety on the palate. Carbonation is low, but adequate for the style while the beer has a drying finish from the high ABV. 
O: Overall this is a really well done Russian Imperial Stout. It has good flavors and a nice amount of complexity. It may have lost a step at this age but it's still drinking very well.",4.5

Black Albert,"#1696 - Blind-tasted except for the beer's name and brewery/country, zero reviews below read (yet!)... 
L- Jet-black to the eye, pours with brief 2mm dark tan head, soon a scattered patch, unsurprising given the ABV% 
S- Like cold Brit Xmas pudding condensed into a liquid, deeply fruity and pungent, plus molasses notes. 
T- Wow, a deep brewed fruity thickness and pungency. Then a blazing shaft of lightly sour + mega-ABV% that makes me involuntarily physically shudder, thankfully briefly. Jeez gawds this thing is intense. I'm getting like ultra-deep concentrated prune juice notes -> back to the molasses in the smell. 
F- It's mega deep, rich/complex, yet also notably has a sour aspect too. 
O- Good grief, what is this thing!? The ABV isn't *that* high but this THING is an absolute beast. Yes it's interesting, and a heck of a statement, but I don't think I really need 330ml of it - it would be a lot more interesting if I had a couple of buddies over and could share, 110ml each, pre a session of other less slaying brews. Interesting to try, but to me it's one of those huge one off statements you experience but wouldn't buy again; this is simply not a 'normal beer'. Oh and for context, it is 1000% the complete antithesis of a session beer. The ABV% isn't even *that* high, as any Icelandic beer-head will attest...  
It's one of those beers that is so different and really hard to know how to rate. Mega flavour/mega naked and shouty ABV%, complete blaster on the palate. Quite probably the most intense beer I've ever had (that is not, of course, a clear compliment). Is this aged in wine casks? That might be the sour note... 
Review/scoring all done, now the reveal, I get to read the bottle lables to see what I missed! ==> Unfilt, unpast. Bot-Con. That's all.  
Does it in fact taste like beer? as I get to the lower 1/4 glass it strikes me more like a noxious dry fortified wine. I'm laching stout notes and certainly more usual Russian Imp Stout notes....

Fantôme Saison,"Pours gold with an average amount of head. Smells musty and funky and strong and you know this is gonna be bold for the style. The taste is sour, dry, and a little bitter at first and then it opens up and you can taste lemon, must, a little grassy, but a prominent, distinctive flavor profile. As saisons go this skews a little towards a sour but it has a few things going on that make it interesting and worth a try, cheers!",4.25
Fantôme Saison,"Re-reviewing this one after 12 years since I last had it.  
 
750mL bottle (best before end of 2025) into a tulip. Pours a clear golden color with a clean bright head, lively carbonation 
 
Wow, the funky aroma on this is pungent! All the usual descriptors—barnyard, wet hay, maybe even dank weed—come immediately to mind. Super strong but not off-putting at all. Just a precursor to the unique flavor in store.  
 
Taste is, not surprisingly, funky and strong. Super dry, kind of like Orval on steroids. Grassy, acidic, with a subtle crushed-aspirin finish. The pale malt and unique yeast strain compete for dominance, unified by bitter Old World hops (Noble? Hallertauer? Saaz? No idea). 
 
Mouthfeel is dominated by the lively carbonation that bites at the palate but gives each sip (or gulp) a crisp, clean finish. Maybe mouthfeel is where this beer excels most—it’s just so refreshing, like champagne.  
 
Overall this is just a unique, special beer. Maybe not one I’d go for every day (and at about $23, IIRC, I couldn’t afford to) but this one is different from any other saison out there—it’s simply the most saison-y saison on the market.

4.44/5 rDev +4.2% 
look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 
750mL bottle (lot no. b-c, best before Jan. 2013) - thanks tai4ji2x! - poured into a Hennepin glass. Watching a replay of le Tour de France from earlier today, Col du Galibier and Alpe d'Huez - happy belated Belgian Independence Day! 
 
Slightly hazy straw color with a 1-finger head, very minimal carbonation - like almost zero. Huh. 
 
Aroma is typical saison funk, apples, pears, grass, and pepper. Nice and bright. 
 
Taste is very dry and clean - almost like a white wine. Lots of fresh fruit, especially white grapes. Not picking up any Belgian yeasty mustiness, just a dry champagne sweetness, with a lot fewer bubbles. 
 
Mouthfeel is slick, oily, just great. 
 
Now as I get toward the bottom of the second full glass, I'm picking up a Bretty tartness - maybe if I'd cellared this for a year or so there would be more of this. 
 
This saison is extremely drinkable. The only disappointment is the near total lack of carbonation, but even that does not significantly detract from the experience. 
 
It's hard to believe this beer was made with barley and not grapes. It really blurs the line between beer and wine like nothing else I've tried.",4.16
Fantôme Saison,"More of a dry sour saison. Not bad, but a little sweeter would have pleased this palate more.",3.89
Fantôme Saison,"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a lightly hazy, medium orange/gold with a four finger white head with great retention and thick lacing; looks nice. Aroma of grainy malt, saison yeast, coriander, lemon and mild summer herbs. Flavor follows with grainy malt, saison yeast with a little funk, coriander, lemon, a touch of honey, apple, hints of light stone fruit; some moderate farmhouse funk in the finish. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. A great, full flavored saison. Hits all the basics of the style in yeast, light fruit, grain and yeast funk. In addition there are wisps of interesting dried fruit and citrus. Great flavor progression with coriander and grain up front and fruit developing over time, finishing with a drier farmhouse funky bite. Dupont saisons are my benchmark for this style and this is as fine or better. This is a really great brewery. So glad they are available again (sporadically) in our area.",4.35

Fantôme Saison,"Poured from 750mL corked & capped green bottle into my BeerAdvocate teku. Bottle says best by end of 2025 -- I should be good. 
 
Appearance: medium golden hue with a bit of haze to the body and a huge effervescence. Head is three thick fingers of frothy eggshell foam that leave a nice lace on the glass. I'm kind of surprised the bottle didn't gush at all, given the huge effervescence and persistent head! 
 
Smell: funky malt with a bit of a spicy character and even just a hint of sourness. Classic, refined, and subtle -- good stuff. 
 
Taste: nice light malt, a little fruity-phenolic character (but not too much!), a little bite, some good bitterness ... this is a damn fine saison. Damn fine indeed. 
 
Mouthfeel: medium body with a big carbonation and just massive creaminess. I love it -- with just a little more body it might be perfect, but it's very, very good as it is. 
 
Overall: I knew this beer was going to be above-average, for sure. But I've had Fantôme beers in a green bottle before, and was underwhelmed. Thankfully this one appears to have been treated right, and it is a treat indeed.",4.45
Fantôme Saison,"I am so happy I finally got to have this beer! Wonderful beer! So smooth and full bodied. Funky and sweet, great taste! Nice hoppy bitterness. Lemony and spicy.

Fantôme Saison,"750ml green bottle. Corked and capped. 
Mostly clear, pale gold colored body. Lots of pillowy white head; it takes a few pours to get a full glass. Keeps the foam as the beer is consumed. 
Aroma is clear with Belgian yeast, with green apple and citrus. 
Taste is similar to a champagne but with more yeast (slightly sour, but in a good way). Citrus and pear. Long fade out in the aftertaste. 
Medium mouth feel with some effervescence. Hints at dryness, but this is from the yeast. Very expressive carbonation. 
Thirst quenching, and has that yeast bite. Yummy.",4.28

Darkstar November,"500 ml bottle into a snifter. 2022 edition, had 1/14/23. 
 
Pours near black and opaque, with no head and a little oily cling. Aromas of bourbon, rye, chocolate, vanilla, roasted malt. Has a bit of a sweet and spicy aroma. Mostly the same flavors: bourbon, rye, chocolate, malt, vanilla, some molasses. Has a fairly spicy taste and a light sweet note. Smooth, a little creamy, a solid full body, appropriately carbonated.  
 
Strong barrels and lots of rye is a pretty good recipe. It’s a little sweeter than expected, but this is pretty delicious.

Bottom of label stamped “2021” and “Batch *008*”. Stored at 34 degrees at home. Served at 61.2 degrees F (Recommended on label 58 degrees F) in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 66.3 degrees F.

Aurelian Lure,"16.9oz bottle. For dating, label includes the details of 'BLEND SEVEN AUGUST 2022'. 
Cloudy, apricot orange colored body. No real lasting head. No lacing. 
Aroma of apricot, oak, and rich funk of expresses horse blanket, leather, and hay. 
Taste is initially quite woody and herb bud like, and then the sweet/sour apricot comes in. Notes of lemon wash through, along with the dry oak. Late is white wine. The funk is very much of grass and hay. After taste does not last very long, but the essence of apricot lingers. 
Tart and drying mouth feel. The teeth are scraped clean with each sip. Quiet carbonation. 
The apricot expresses so naturally here, and is the longest lasting flavor note. The herb, oak, funk, and lemon are worthy subordinates.",4.45
Aurelian Lure,"Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy light amber color with a bubbly collar that fades away; no lacing 
 
Smell: Bracingly sour; funky with an apricot tone 
 
Taste: A hint of apricot passes across the tongue and is followed by a strong funky character; the apricot tone lingers underneath though, after the swallow, a bracing sourness emerges; oaky, dry and a lot of pucker in the finish 
 
Mouthfeel: Light to medium body; no carbonation 
 
Overall: Not for the uninitiated, Aurelian Lure harkens back to some of the tongue buckling sours that largely seem to have gone out of fashion these days",4.22

Aurelian Lure,,3.83
Aurelian Lure,"Brewed with apricots, spontaneously fermented and allowed to ripen to full sour ale maturity, you'd think that this time honored way of beer making is rooted in the belly of Brussels. But nope, it's Austin Texas. 
 
Aurelian Lure is the lambic-like brainchild of Jester King, pouring with a pale and deep lemon yellow with a light golden center. As the yeasty ale rises with a dainty champagne froth, the jaw-tightening scent of citrus, vinous and stone fruit carry the piquant tang of cider, dusty funk and extended oak aged white wine. As a scantly sweet taste briefly visit the tongue, early impressions of wafers, honey and sourdough offer a slim malt impact. 
 
A quick wash of acidity across the middle palate shows a quick erase of anything malty and an ushering in of sour apricot that stand proud above the other fruity complements of weathered lemon, grapefruit, lime and yuzu. Dried pineapple, peach and white grape all continue to grow from the natural fermentae of the sour ale and play into a strikingly sour late palate of off-vinegar, mature and peppery acids that pang away on the sides of the tongue. 
 
Light, crisp, succinct and highly refreshing, the session is sweat inducing and tooth achingly sour to satisfy the taste for unblended lambic in the deep south. As an afterglow of weathered woods, wine rot and an overall mossy type of earthiness come in brief waves, the aftertaste is otherwise short and concisely winey.",4.26
Aurelian Lure,,4.24
Aurelian Lure,"Murky darker yellow body with a white cap. Smell blasts you with sour apricot backed by complex oak, orange and farmhouse yeast. Taste is a cover up of the scandal. The scandal you ask? The apricot is wickedly acidic and pretty sour too, this is then covered up by farmhouse yeast, light barrel funk, lemon, and oak, but for that moment when the scandal was alone on the palate it was rough. Very bright and sour, funk is not impactful here, oak is brightly so, acidity builds as the secret wants to get out. I love JK but this is the #15 wild ale in the world? Nah, I wouldn't have this again",3.94
Aurelian Lure,,4.31
Aurelian Lure,,4.5
Aurelian Lure,"Pours a hazy golden color with a thin head that dissipates immediately. The aroma is immediately noticeable, with a strong scent of apricots and a subtle hint of oak. Upon tasting, the apricot flavor dominates, with a tartness that is balanced by a slight sweetness. The oak barrel aging adds a layer of complexity, imparting a mild vanilla flavor that complements the fruitiness of the apricots. The beer finishes with a refreshing tartness that lingers on the tongue, leaving a dry finish. 
One of the standout features of Aurelian Lure is its balance. Despite being a sour ale, the tartness is not overwhelming, and is instead complemented by the sweetness of the apricots and the subtle oak notes. This makes for a beer that is both complex and approachable, with a flavor profile that is likely to appeal to both seasoned sour beer enthusiasts and those new to the style. 
Another noteworthy aspect of Aurelian Lure is its mouthfeel. The beer is medium-bodied with a light carbonation, which adds to the refreshing quality of the beer. The combination of tartness and effervescence make this a perfect summer beer, though it's enjoyable year-round. 
Overall, Jester King Brewery's Aurelian Lure is a fantastic sour ale that showcases the brewery's expertise in wild yeast and spontaneous fermentation. It's a beer that is both complex and approachable, with a balanced flavor profile and a refreshing mouthfeel. While it may be difficult to find due to its limited availability, it's certainly worth seeking out for any beer enthusiast looking to try something truly special.",4.46

Juicy,"Bottled on February 14, 2020. Pours a vibrant golden color with a finger of medium density white head that receded to a thin ring. Aroma is excellent. A combination of wine barrels, orange, lemon and miscellaneous tropical fruits burst from the glass. Maybe a little bit of tart funk, but it definitely takes a back seat.  
 
On the tongue, the funk is much more present. The taste leads with wine barrel / oak funk. Mid palate I get some tropical notes, along with wildflowers. I don't believe any dandelions are in this beer, but to me it tastes like they are. On the very long finish, the funk has more of an earthy feel. Surprisingly full body. Well carbonated and smooth, despite a bit of acidity.  
 
Overall, this is an excellent beer. Complex and layered in a way I don't often see. The barrels really add to the experience. An excellent example of what happens when skill and patience combine.",4.47

Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"2016 Vintage(I Think) 
 
A: Poured into a snifter to a black beer which is topped by a small light tan head which fades quickly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing 
S: Smells of brandy barrels with some chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts 
T: Taste is chocolate and coffee up front with some brandy barrel influence. Hints of roasted malts and toasted marshmallows. On the swallow there's more brandy barrel, chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts 
M: This beer has a body which is lighter than anticipated and slightly silky. Carbonation is quite low, but it is there while the beer has a sightly drying finish due to the ABV 
O: Overall this beer is quite good. It has also held up well over time. Complexity also grows as the beer warms. It's definitely worth a try if you like barrel aged beers.",4.75

Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"Pours black with a finger of khaki foam. Head retention is good after an aggressive pour. Aroma is big. Apple brandy, toffee, barrel, char, and caramel dance and play over roasty and toasty malts. Flavor profile is medium-thin. Roasty and toasty malts lead the charge. Toffee, caramel, molasses, and apple brandy tag on for a flavorful brew. Mouth feel is velvety, and soft, but never hits creamy. It has a medium-thick consistency. Overall, solid stout with hints of apple brandy coming through.

It gets better as it warms UP 
 
The mouthfeel is dry but not astringent, fine natural carbonation

A huge shoutout to merpunk1 for hooking me up with this one in a trade! It’s the highest rated Bière de Champagne (and #245 overall), so it’s only fitting to drink this baby on New Years Eve. The rest of the day/night will consist of old classics, but it’s nice to open something fancy for my last review of 2021. Let’s get into it 
 
Pours a cloudy orange gold with a finger of white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing. Eventually fades to absolutely nothing but it's still a decent looking beer 
 
Man, I'm really digging the nose on this one, funky and delicate at the same time. I'm picking up on aromas of white grape, white wine vinegar, tangerine, sharp oak, and earthy apple 
 
It's straight up explosive in taste, in your face and complex while being downright drinkable. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting tart green apple, sour white grape, wet hay, sharp oak, lemon zest, and crackery malt. The swallow brings notes of earthy white white, old leather, tart white grape, apple skin, sharp oak, floral honey, and lemon zest  
 
A light medium body pairs with fine carbonation, resulting in a tart and crisp beer. Finishes mostly dry with just a touch of residual sweetness 
 
This is great stuff, and a great kickoff to NYE. It's been a hell of a 2021, both on here and in my life and general. So, cheers BA, happy new year!",4.31

The head fizzled away almost immediately but that is typical for the style. The nose is just superb: like a fine Chardonnay; I'm smelling lemon, orange peel, and peach. It's taste is sublime; funky, oaky white wine grape with soft notes of peach that sweeten the Brettanomyces and native Missouri microflora. It's so delicate and fine. It has the expected effervescence and it doesn't drink like 10% ABV. Overall, Blanc De Blancs is an absolute delight. I'm privileged to have had the chance to try it.",4.49

I got this bottle for retail on the shelf mostly because I love Prairie and I knew people flip for this beer. Upon opening it, the smell is very distinct and I just don't like it! It smells the way it's supposed to smell, it's just that the apple brandy barrel of off putting to me. Now on the tongue, it's a completely different story for me. The apple is there but distinct and really appealing. A tiny bit tart? The stout's sweetness works well with this barrel. It also helps for it to be a bit warmer too.

IPA,Served up in a pint. Sparky and sting notes of pine and grapefruit. Taste is chewy and strongly fresh and bitter with a thick middle and a heavy bitter finish. Very good.,4
IPA,"Poured from a 12oz can 
 
On the pour, 3 fingers of white, well supported head were present that forms nice damage. Body is a deep deep gold with super fine carbonation rising up. 
 
Aroma is super bright and happy with an overhanging darkness. Bright, floral, fruity, and dank, with a sweet malt. Not the most balanced. 
 
Flavor is more balanced than the aroma, and the malt comes off as less sweet. There is a piney and slightly citrus hop note up front that slowly builds in bitterness and darkness. Solid slightly sweet, and bread malt backbone. Some herbal hops are present as well I realized. 
 
Feel is very full, and verging on heavy. The malt is mouthcoating and the hops are too. Not overwhelming but very full with a slight hint of alcohol. 
 
Overall this is pretty good, but I'd argue not quite world class. Could be crispier and the hops could have a more focused flavor. Probably best to go into this expecting an imperial English IPA, because this has some English hop vibes as well.",3.8

Tastes initially of sweet bready malt, tropical fruit and ripe orange. Piney and herbal bitterness follow with hints of grapefruit and resin at the back of the palate. 
Medium mouthfeel, nicely carbonated with a smooth drying bitter finish.",4.27

Aroma of citrus and pine. Pine, grapefruit, and resin bitterness. 
Taste follows the nose, with orange, grapefruit, and pineapple joined by pine resin bitterness. A little sweet but with a bitter tail end. Very good toasted malt base.

Aromas of sweet malts, chocolate and bourbon. Smells delicious. 
 
The first sip follows the aroma with a sweet, malty chocolate taste with a distinct bourbon background. Slightly acidic aftertaste. The bourbon aging is done perfectly as it never overpowers the beer. The ABV is lurking there but isn’t dominate.  
 
A rich, smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Leaves a nice coating in the mouth. Medium carbonation. 
 
Overall, a delicious stout that ranks up there with the best. A beer that truly highlights what a stout can be with the proper barrel aging and care that Central Waters has given this brew…highly recommended. Cheers!",4.4
Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout,"Appearance: Pours a very dark brown body with a medium-small-sized, light khaki-colored head. 
 
Smell: A sliver of char with woodsy, bourbon-moist barrel tones leading to bittersweet chocolate morsels, smooth roast and brown sugar with a slight fruitiness of blueberry, blackberry. 
 
Taste: Sweetish, chocolaty with plenty of warming oaken, spiced, woodsy, bourbon tones, a bit charry and ashen. More brown sugar and again the softly tangy fruitiness, but it's fairly well-integrated, as in its not ganky-level sweet or housing a jolt of fruitiness. Final zip of fruitiness, sweetness and heat, though it wraps up reasonably dry for a big stout. 
 
Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium-light carbonation. Just a bit chewy, though far from being gummy or gloopy.

Crusher,"Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Canned June 21st 2023. 
 
Hazed and opaque body with a muted orange but fairly dark and still. A mix of custard but has a much darker than expected color. The beer nearly appears frozen. Head is quite soapy, fine white bubbles of three fingers with light retention. Shampoo like top but lots of ring lacing to match. 
 
Aroma is a hop surprise. Hints of soft dank, but a real gumdrop like candy sweetness that matches nicely. Thick and rich, with a light sense of sweet malt to counter as well. The contrast between dank and sweet hop aroma on this is exceptional. Huge juicy dank sweet punch is the only way I can describe it, like hop thick Kool-Aid. 
 
Palate brings things a little more into focus, but does not hold back. Mid palate hits with a hot but delicious earthy mid palate punch. Large and bold, but controlled hop blasts of pine, earth, juiced candy orange pineapple and mango rolling into a minty finish that just does not quit. It doesn't stop there, with a creamed earthy mouthfeel that feels like a sundae, and smells like sweet tilled garden earth.

Crusher,"Appearance: The Alchemist Crusher New England IPA has a golden, hazy appearance with a creamy white head. 
 
Aroma: The aroma is a combination of citrus and tropical fruit, such as grapefruit, orange, and mango, with hints of pine. 
 
Taste: On the palate, the beer is smooth and juicy, with a balanced blend of sweet and bitter flavors. The tropical fruit and citrus notes are prominent, and there is a slight hop bitterness in the finish. 
 
Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is soft and creamy, with a medium body and a slight carbonation. 
 
Overall Impression: The Alchemist Brewing Crusher New England IPA is a delicious and refreshing beer with a well-balanced flavor profile. It is an excellent example of the New England IPA style, and it is perfect for a warm day or to pair with a spicy meal. The aroma, taste, and mouthfeel all work together to create a satisfying drinking experience.",4.84

Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,"22 oz bomber (2015) 
 
A- Pours pitch black with a thin mocha colored head. Minimal lacing throughout.  
 
S- Dark chocolate comes through immediately with undertones of vanilla. There is a light undercurrent of cinnamon wafting in the background. I take an extra strength whiff (for science) and only then can I start picking up some stale, oxidation characteristics. It is nearly imperceptible and has no real impact.  
 
T- Following closely from the nose, the flavor starts off with smooth dark chocolate dominating at first, with the vanilla providing ample support. As the beer warms to room temperature, the cinnamon starts its move from the periphery to becoming a more integral component. Cinnamon is something which can easily be off putting to me in larger doses but here it is well integrated and nicely complements the stronger chocolate and vanilla flavors. No perceptible heat or spiciness to me from the chile peppers. It's quite possible this aspect has faded over time. I do think there are some remnants adding to the total flavor profile but I'm just not able to easily pick them out. The only slight knock I can give is that the barrel characteristics are minimal.  
 
M - Slightly oily with a medium body. Carbonation (medium) has held up quite well.  
 
O - For whatever reason, I had low expectations going in for this beer after being cellared for six years. However, it has held up remarkably well in that time. I regrettably did not have this beer when it was released so cannot give any comparison. On its own, it's a delicious beer.",4.41

Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,"I received a can from @FBarber in a BIF. Canned on 1/29/2020. Poured into a snulip glass. I took it out of the fridge about 2 hours before pouring, then put it back in about 15 minutes before pouring. It pours a very dark walnut - approaching black. The medium mocha head dissipated very quickly, a sign of the alcohol content. Lots of raisin on the nose, along with roasted malt, chocolate, a whiff of freshly-brewed coffee, and earthy charred nuts. You can also readily smell the bourbon barrel. This is right in my wheelhouse taste-wise. It opens with bakers chocolate and coffee but the raisin has carried over, as well. There are also notes of caramel and earthy char, and the caliente pepper adds heat. The bourbon barrel is strong but not distractingly so. As the glass warms, I think the chocolate is stronger and a bit sweeter and the pepper hotter. The feel is viscous and creamy with lite carbonation and there's no avoiding the 14% ABV. The 12 oz. format is appropriate. Overall, this is a superb example of RIS - my favorite style, and it richly deserves its World-Class rating. I really like the combination of the chocolate malts and dark fruit.",4.64
Earthquake High Gravity Lager (10%),"Poured from a julian dated 24oz can. 
 
On a rough pour 3 fingers of white almost decent, if not a bit foamy, white head formed, then becomes rocky and recedes to just under 1cm. Body is a clear, but relatively dark gold with lots of carbonation. Somehow lacing does form at an acceptable level, but the bubbles are larger than normal. 
 
Aroma is enjoyably vague as if it were any more potential smelling it would be indistinguishable from an extremely cheap and old white wine. Slight 6-row sweetness somewhere in the but it doesn't meld very well. 
 
Flavor is somehow better than the aroma, and honestly much better than expected. Still the tart, cheap white wine thing is still there right up front, before fading to a surprisingly light, bit present malty lager flavor. There is a slight bitterness that pops in at the beginning then quickly disappears, likely an off flavor. 
 
Feel is surprisingly light for the ""style"". Not to call it drinkable, but when cold, it does come off as a little refreshing assuming you have nothing to do. As it warms it does begin to linger more. 
 
Overall, despite its obvious flaws I would definitely call this a pleasant surprise for not completely offending my taste buds. Definitely put it in the freezer before consuming, but also definitely better than the Camo malt liquors.",2.5

Earthquake High Gravity Lager (10%),"24 ounce can into IPA glass, canned on 4/4/2022. Pours slightly hazy pale golden straw color with a 2-3 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Dense foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. This was..... not too bad. Aromas and flavors of big plum, pear, red apple, corn, cereal, white bread, herbal, wood, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Super fruity DMS nose as it warmed. Light herbal/grassy bitterness and slight alcohol spiciness on the finish. Medium-high carbonation, light-medium body, and fairly crisp/clean finishing. Balanced bready/grainy malt and sticky hops in the mouthfeel. Light lingering bitter dryness, no cloying/astringency. Very easy to drink and pretty clean on lager flavors, but the aftertaste lingers with dms and it's a bit much. Otherwise really minimal warming after the finish for 10%. I actually kind of regret buying this haha, it was cheap though. Good for a buzz and nothing else, by design. It also has some kind of distinct yeast or grain note that seems to be common with the four loko lineup. The can says Drink Four brewing does make this.",3.34
Earthquake High Gravity Lager (10%),"It smells damn near like turpentine or rubbing alcohol, doesn't have the same ""friendly"" taste of basically any other lager, despite saying ""high gravity lager"" in its name, its even more different than hurricane or steel reserve (which have less harsh aftertaste) but still more redeemable than Smirnoff beer which is almost unbearable in taste. The real standout here is that once you sip or chug this puppy, you get blitzed, but not so f@cked up as four loko which has amazing ""output"" but results in unintended hurling which killed its potential early on. Not what I'd call a great malt liquor, if that's what you're looking for. The best tasting beer thus far would seem to be OE, but it doesn't have the impact this thing has. Definitely more of a ""I wanna be loaded, but not to the point of hangover"" scenario. I don't even get why someone would wanna keep drinking after having this, that's the type of experience it induced, if you want to be honest, in my opinion.",3.01

Gratitude,"A: A bole toned decant with a burnt umber aid through the emissions, while the carafe transpires a canvas brown invention. The process is repeated upon the timed stagnations, where the transfers offer/develop a nuanced clarity. At the outset, a complementary collar that briefly supersedes the inch, by suggesting a unison amongst polypeptides & acids. This comes with a bisque to champagne tinge, as the progression works to sever that stature thru a golden fog rim. Accordingly, a severance that offers an elegant latticework, from the refined residues, without obligatory tension. In time, a viscosity element over the painted – monastery – windows, as the increments capitulate a heating engraving  
 
S: A malt to yeast webwork that’s pitted against a new level, of aged refermentation, as the hop effect distantly grows. The entryway hints at the components most found in a Stroopwafel, aside the rich caramel conveys. Moreover, an isoamyl octanoate undercoat to the more direct – dark – fruit bearings, where figs atop flame raisins, before softly ciphering in Pflaumenmus. There is a deciduous camphor airstream in circumference, which adds a mint to menthol element, while a coniferous scots builds upon the bittering strengths. Correspondingly, an earthy headway amongst the woodsy incursions, as hyssop connotations develop, beyond the clove & marjoram orifices. The starch-to-sugar conversions have lessened over the timespan, which lends a relaxed saccharification to the aforementioned pillars. A movement that addresses the vintage through a smart solvency, given the calculated repression on oxygenation. This comes not only with the years, but with phased transfers across balmy – hourly – increments. To that extent, an ethyl acetate reflection that involves a nuanced perception on sherry, for getting Amontillado to reach Latakia tobacco  
 
T: The timeworn has elevated the initial sensitivity on the diastatic enzyme conversions to a new level, which augments the sweetness, by progression. As a result, the gustation is more relaxed on the greenery counters, as the grain bill pushes those bready to doughy reserves. Albeit, a hop effect that remains central to the course, while esters assist in the hourly altitudes. The dispatches are therefore rich in malt outputs, by slinging heath bars aside Torta de nata. Coupled with, barhi dates & dried goji berries, as the yeast draws on an ethyl hexanoate chord. This being the implied red fruits with an aniseed cast, while a colophony sphere mitigates. Due to that fact, a tactful hop impact to impart pine needles near dry cedar wood, while contextualizing floral bouquets. There is a citrus – grapefruit – bitter articulation thru the expansion, which accompanies the candied stone fruits, as acetates build off the clocked intervals. Meanwhile, a distant decant subjected to open air, besides the added years, for degassed complexities over Bustrengo. The notes persevere on the heated draws near Bärenjäger & smoked lavender, while lightly addressing the behaviors most akin to phenylethanols with a caproate partnership. Sequentially, the vintage escorts the 4th hour @ a >78°F interval to lend Madeira, by suggesting Malmsey, which pursues an oxidized nuttiness. A continuation that implores burning Grow houses under elderly Dunskins, beyond the fiery red grounds  
 
M: Cut – bygone – ebullitions amidst a refined adhesiveness, which amends sweetness against the fermentable complications. A warming surface structure that’s smooth upon equalizing, from an age-old viscosity to a calm desiccation. The output is time-honored with an intrinsic richness, as ethanol smartly burns over an attenuated cessation, while a suppressed bite rearguards the aridity  
 
O: An oxidized comfort with a refermented/conditioned involvedness, which kindles a fine silkiness without barrel foreplay. Accordingly, a non-barrel aged vintage that swaps esters, for the more habitual acetates, when calming the greeneries. In this case, the added time is paired alongside an uncapped & decanted patience, as a way to recognize the impact contingent on evaporation and oxidation",4.32

Aroma is sweet caramel and molasses with fig and some light alcohol lurking. It's fairly reserved overall, in that nothing bursts from the glass. That said, it still smells quite good.  
 
On the tongue, the alcohol makes a clear and immediate impression, as does the bite from the hops. The malts definitely take a back seat. There's a little bit of sweetness, but it's clearly secondary.

The amber hue is beautiful. Also noting hefty sediment st the bottom of the glass. 
 
The smell isn't mind blowing. Its fairly benign and unassuming. 
 
The flavor profile is very bigfoot-esque but definitely better. Its less bitter than Bigfoot and has more caramel sweetness. Still, a pretty bitter and quintessential example of an American barleywine. In fact... i would argue this is probably THEE American barleywine measuring stick. Bigfoot is just too much of a palate wrecker though it does convey all the aspects to familiarize one with the style. Gratitude does it equally as well but with more refinement IMO. 
 
The feel is a little sticky up front but dries out quickly on the finish as you exhale an evaporating heavy dose of ethanol. 
 
Overall Im drinking this one at cellar temperature of about 57ish and I'm not enjoying it quite as much as I recall previously. Could be a beer thats better more chilled, could be I'm off (very likely), or could be accurate at 4.25.

Gratitude,"Pours a deep burgundy-caramel color with a couple fingers of off-white foam. Transparency is obscured by a firm haze. Aroma is fig, raisins, molasses, toffee, and strong earthy, toasty, and caramely malts underneath. Resiny, earthy hops extend the nose a bit further, adding a light stickiness that's overshadowed by a dirty, earthy note. It really leans more into an earthy nose, with malts and hops building on this quality. Booze is obscured. Flavor profile is caramel, toffee, molasses, fig, and raisins layered over malts and hops. Malts are forward, coming by way of earthy, caramely, and toasty, they ride the heels of the former list of flavor notes. Hops don't become apparent until the after taste, which carries a heavy sticky, resiny hop quality, in addition to mild dank and pine. It never leans into sweet, nor bitterness, striking a middle-of-the-road balance. Booze never pops through. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a still, boiled texture. Overall, driving malts and big, sticky hops keep this one lively. It's simplistic, perhaps a little 'old school', but is otherwise clean. Allowed to warm quite a bit, between sitting it out before the pour photo, and playing some Wii Resort Golf, it warmed towards 55F. It become more muddled as it warmed, which is contradictive to the style.

All the right moves.  
Lest it be taken for granted, it is burn-free, attenuated, silky - all of the things you’d expect from German precision brewing. If I’m forced to find fault, it’s a bit undercarbed which makes it play a touch sweeter than it should.  
Also surprised and delighted by all the fruit - I can’t help thinking that this brings many of the notes that make Baltic Porter great but in a much more drinkable package. That makes this even less bready and more estery than Korbinian; I’d love to drink the two side by side.

Red Poppy Ale,"1900 
Name: Red Poppy 
Brewery: The Lost Abbey 
Location: San Marcos 
Style: Barrel-Aged Wild Ale 
ABV: 6.5% 
Date:  
I have searched for this beer for quite a while; I stumbled upon it about two years ago. Climbing to 1900 reviews should be something special to drink. I have been wanting to drink this and Cable Car. Using a tulip glass, I served the beer at around 48 degrees. The pour created an off-white frothy one-fingered head with poor retention. The quick dissipation left no lacing on the glass. Looking at the murky color in the cup, I would chart it around SRM 26, dark rusty brown. The appearance is about average for this style.  
Nosing the glass, I smell barnyard, cherries, horse blankets, fruity sweetness, acidic acid, wine, oak, and a fruity tartness.  
I taste tart jammy cherries, barnyard funk, straw, oak, acidic acid, winey, slight fruity sweetness, herbal, lightly floral, and yeasty.  
The mouthfeel is puckering and tart, finishing dry. The body is medium with a medium-plus carbonation.  
This is a fantastic beer! The cherries are bright, vibrant, and tart, with a wild yeasty flair. This could be too much pucker power for some people, but I find it delightful. I would love a few more bottles of this and let it age for several years to see if the pucker power is tamed. Overall, great beer; glad I got to consume it.",4.35

The nose is fantastic; oak & jammy cherry; puckering. The palate hits with sour cherry, medium tannin, and dry oak. Carbonation is completely gone, which is a shame. Without it, that acid comes on a little too strong. Opened to honor our daughter, Poppy!",4.02

L: Pours a minimally reddish muddy brown with a foamy beige head that leaves plenty of lacing. Lots of fine floaters. 
 
S: Ripe sour cherries and poppy seeds. Yeasty, funky and slightly vinegary. 
 
T: The sweeter notes are less present than in the smell, but they are definitely there in a fresher form. Tart, yeasty and very earthy. Hints of fruity red wine. 
 
F: Quite soft and smooth despite its strong carbonation. 
 
O: Very good American take on a classic Belgian style. Fresh and fruity with the barrel coming through really nicely. Great balance. Subtle complexity. Already looking forward to try some older vintages.",4.26

Red Poppy Ale,"Red Poppy pours a vibrant ruddy brown color with a massive tan head that dissipates quickly and unevenly, producing a short-lived rocky effect that’s quite pretty while it lasts before leaving a film-like cap, a thick crown and some spotty strands of lacing. 
 
It has a nice aroma of vinegar and cherry with both leather and some slightly creamy notes behind. 
 
That great vinegary Flanders quality continues to the taste, with the edges nicely rounded by the fruit and perhaps by age. There’s a definite red wine element to it also, which provides some depth I enjoy. The taste closes with a fairly tart, drying finish that lets just a little of the cherry juice linger. 
 
The feel’s medium bodied and soft with soft carbonation. 
 
This is a really well-made beer. The cherry doesn’t pop as much as, say, Alexander, but it’s a pleasant undercurrent throughout and counteracts the acidity. Can’t really say what the poppy seeds added, but they certainly don’t detract from the beer in any way.  
 
I couldn’t find a clear bottling date anywhere on here, but there’s a raised, unobtrusive “19” on the glass, making me think that’s when the bottle and/or beer was made.",4.18
Red Poppy Ale,"Purchased in November 2021 from HopHeads in Altona, on the outer western edge of Melbourne, in Australia. Drunk in July 2022. 
 
Pours a bright burgundy colour. There's no evident carbonation and no head.  
 
The nose is strongly sour cherry and balsamic vinegar. There are hints of vanilla. The aroma already has my mouth watering, but it's already presenting as something that's going to be overwhelmingly sour and acidic. I'm not sure I'm looking forward to it... 
 
The taste, oh my, the taste. It's bracing. It's like the first time I had a Warhead lolly, with an immediate reaction of ""wow, that's sour"". In fact, it's extremely sour, like a mouthful of sour (Morello) cherries. There's also a sharp, dry kick at the end. As it warms it mellows slightly but develops tannic notes and grape or cherry skin highlights, to the point it begins to resemble a red wine, but with a residual vinegar aftertaste. 
 
The mouthfeel is sharp, and it's almost stinging on the way down. Not terribly enjoyable for mine. 
 
Overall this is too sour and then too much like I'm drinking a glass of red wine. I've read a number of reviews and none seem to mirror the harshness of my experience with the beer, which was not an enjoyable one. Maybe I had a bad bottle or it had been treated poorly before reaching me? Not sure, but I can only go on my evidence.

Red Poppy Ale,"Not able to try Lost Abbey often, but this was gifted me in a recent Can-Cans BIF so I got to try it. 
Mixed reaction, glad to be drinking it, bummed I can't go to the store and buy any around here. 
But that's not a review- 
Poured from 12 oz ""stovepipe"" can into a stemless teku glass. Color brown, like a strongly brewed iced tea, but the tan head that quickly builds and faded to mere lacing assures me this isn't tea. 
The aroma is definitely cherry forward, but backed by malts of unknown origin. Unexpected but very pleasant. 
Taste leaves everything I experienced with this beer in the rear view. Tart cherries strongly edge a malty base and combine in a way I've never experienced in a sour before. Really something. And really good! 
Feel is tingly, but not from carbonation. crisp and smooth, how that's simultaneously done I may never know. 
Good beer. Bummed its only 12 oz now.",4.6

This smells roasted coffee beans and espresso, milk chocolate, oak, smoke, and bourbon, with a touch of a vegetal aroma. 
 
This is solid up front, but there's this odd and stale vegetal taste on the back end that seems to be the beginnings of the coffee turning towards the dreaded green pepper phase. Fortunately, up front the coffee flavor is nice, lightly smokey and roasty, a nice chocolatey porter base. There's a little bit of bourbon, and it's melded into the flavor nicely and doesn't dominate or stick out too boozily. 
 
This is medium bodied, fairly creamy, and surprisingly rich for the ABV and style. It's fairly drinkable.

I am up late (or early) & now it is time for some coffee! I Pop!ped the cap & began a C-Line pour into the awaiting glass. I was dissatisfied with its initial production of head so I performed a vigorous in-glass swirl to raise just under two fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, deep-tan/light-brown head with moderate retention, leaving loads of lacing in its wake. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose was redolent with coffee & it was like I was mansplaining on F night - Porters might be close to Stouts, but they do have differences & Porters often recieve adjuncts as a result of their receptiveness, coffee & fruits being the most prevalent. The nose also had a light wafting of coconut which I now recognize as Bourbon-Bbl. aging. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, not quite creamy, but close. I allowed it to warm in my mouth, on my tongue & coating my palate, all bringing out a rich Bourbon flavor underlain by dark, black coffee! Mmm. Cigars with coffee infused with a shot of bourbon on the fantail of the SDTS ... I was not happy with my shore duty assignment to an underway vessel, but being that it was mostly silly-vilians, things were more relaxed. This beer was evocative of those evenings, anchored or moored in the lee sides of the Channel Islands. I no longer smokes cigars, thanks to adult-onset asthma, but I miss the heck out of them, especially when drinking something like this. I have never been a huge fan of Bourbon, preferring the minty spiciness of Rye, but beer seems to love being aged in Bourbon Bbls. In turn, I love the aged beer, Finish was dry and boozy, but that was okay by me since they copped to it on the label. I just dislike getting blindsided.",4.34

Smell: Hop backbone, citrusy, namely orange and grapefruit. Notes of brett and pepper. 
Taste: Balanced. The citrusy hops mingle well with the brett notes. Hop bitterness is low. Brett, peppery and citrusy hops are at the top. The finish has a nice malty tinge and tastes of alcohol. As it gets warmer, the pepper notes really come through, like Tank 7. 
Mouthfeel: Effervescent burn, light bodied, soft, crisp, refreshing, smooth enough, dry. It touches the lips and tongue with a gentle caress.

Saison-Brett,"Had a 2011 bottle back in September 2015. Bottle # 12235.  
 
Pours a darker golden color, hints of mild cloudiness and with a big ol' full on head exceeding 1"". Aroma imparted notes of grain, alcohol, hay, rawhide, pepper and bitter melon.  
 
Taste allayed my fears about this being too big and an ""imperial"" saison. 8.5% is too big normally, but somehow this kept its style guideline roots. Mouth feel stayed relatively dry and light instead of dropping an oppressive amount of alcohol. More lemon tartness in the taste than aroma. A little bit of other citrus beyond that, a pear note and a pineapple note. Minimal band aid phenol funk notes. Even though it was 4 years old, it didn't seem much different than fresher pours I've had of it.  
 
At the end of the day its a very good beer, but the price point (around $20) is such that I dunno how often I can buy a bottle of it. A pour on tap, sure, knock it out every time. But a bottle, that is sometimes tough because you can get other ones for half the price.",3.89

Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),"Pours a slightly cloudy, deep, dark amber coloration with a small, fizzy head. Smells of slightly doughy, caramelly malt and estery fruits, with notes of red apple, apricot and gooseberry, as well as hints of hay, spice, funk and oak. Taste is a great balance of slightly doughy and caramelly malt and rich notes of estery fruit and lighter spice, with notes of red apple, apricot, gooseberry, clove and peppery spice, as well as some musty funk and slightly tannic oak. Finished with a medium tartness and some estery fruit and spice, as well as musty fubnk and oak lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbontion. 
 
While this stands on its own very well, it certainly is by far the best value for money I ever encountered when it comes to Gueuze, although your mileage may vary. I paid 4€ for this 375ml bottle and honestly enjoyed it better than some more established and expensive examples of the style. It's a bit more malt-forward than your average Gueuze, which is not a bad thing at all in my book, while being quite funky, with a certain musty, leathery quality to it. The esters are coming through nicely as well, quite fruity, with hints of spice, while are also some tannic, oaky accents to this.

Fourth Dementia (4D),"Pours a near-black until the last couple ounces, when it turns into a muddy brown with a burgundy-tint. Head is a finger of beige foam. Aroma is raisins, dark fruits, caramel, and toasty, caramely, bready malts. Faint bourbon and barrel come thru as well, but don't do enough to raise the temp of the aroma. It's potent, but balanced. Flavor profile packs a little bit more than the aroma, bringing raisins, dark fruits, caramel, toffee, and chocolate with roasty, caramely, and bready malts underneath. Faint whiskey underneath, which brings a little heat wave, but nothing that disrupts the balance. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a silty texture. Effervescence is soft. Alcohol flattens out the final third. Overall, an easy going 13.5% Old Ale that manages to display whiskey along the way, without being unwieldy. That said, it's still fill and fun.

Pours a clear, deep, ruddy chestnut brown body capped with a slight finger of fluffy, off-beige foam; solid head retention leaves a thin layer of intermittent cap, a thin, creamy collar, and virtually no lacing holding to the walls of the glass. 
 
Aroma is entirely dominated by and centered around twangy raisin coursing throughout; an underlying dusting of bakers chocolate details figgy esters and faded caramels over time, while an increasingly luscious and jammy raisin holds focus. 
 
Taste opens to raisin juice accented with toasted fig, burnt black bread, and molasses, with distant chocolate and wisps of nutty undertones progressing to the mid-palate as dark fruit jam peaks; brown sugar born from a residual sweetness phases into intermittent booziness amplifying subtler dark fruit esters as they linger through the finish. 
 
Mouthfeel features a rounded medium body with a composed, moderate-high carbonation, lively yet rounded while dispersing to slick, semi-syrupy, even textures over the mid-palate, and eventually drying as a distant char balances a moderate warmth through the finish. 
 
Approaching a decade in the bottle, this old ale has refined and embraced an undeniably one-note character, sparking depth through sheer focus on a singular profile development to showcase a concentrated display of age across a quality base; an increasingly decadent sipper by way of a stalwart longevity.",4.14

(12 years old!)  
Dark fruits,(prune, raisins), toffee, leather, wood, slight oxidization.  
99% flat. No booziness. Smooth.  
Overall: Though definitely old, this ages pretty well. Those melded flavors only age can produce. Ages better than most beers out there. From what I’ve read Lost Abbey was probably flat even when fresh.",4.27
The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"The Angel’s Share is from 2016. Pours dark, dark brown. Almost black. Very little carbonation during the pour, and then a bit after it was all poured. Immediate aroma of bourbon. I was surprised it was so strong after 4-5 years. Taste follows - big bourbon presence, which makes me happy, because I love bourbon barrel aged beers. Between the color being almost black and the bourbon dominating, this is very close to a bourbon barrel aged stout instead of a barleywine. If given in a blind tasing I might think it was. There’s very little barleywine characteristic: it’s not sweet, don’t get any caramel or toffee. It’s still a bit boozy, but I like that in beers like this.",4.46

The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Viscous, opaque garnet-brown with no head; strong bourbon nose with hints of wood, cherry stone, candy sugar, moss, plum and oak smoke; fig, milk chocolate, red currants, a whisky hit with a big thread of vanilla, sweet comeback + warming end; medium-full, chewy, round.

Sat on this for 5 years.  
No looker, but smells like a humidor - once you get past the booziness, the complexity of the aroma drips down the back of your throat.  
The taste is dried dark fruit more than any caramel sweetness. And then that bourbon drops in… while among the most harmonious I’ve encountered, it does take over more than complement the base beer.  
Not perfect: it’s flat + boozy - hard to avoid at 12.5%, but it should've mellowed with age. I see lots of good ratings for this, but some are a decade old - maybe this beer jumped out more before everything was getting put in barrels.  
Overall, this has more in common with treacly English strong ales than anything else. But with a lot of bourbon.

Grain Belt Premium Light,"this is pretty rough stuff, one of the outwardly cheaper tasting beers in this style space, heck of a lousy aftertaste, but with some value when absolutely ice cold, and i mean near freezing, on a hot day, if you can keep the clear glass out of the sun, a few quick glugs can really wet the whistle, but deeper analysis reveals only critique for me. average looking yellow brew, high shine, fizzy at first but not keeping it. the nose is metallic, adjuncty all the way, corny sweet to me, a little floral but but really specifically from hops it doesnt seem, some light struck character too, and not a clean or crisp lager yeast profile, its unresolved. the flavor agrees, and while the first half isnt bad, some pils type malt at first, the second half falls apart, detergent, paper, pennies, confectionary sugar, cream corn. i want to like this, and even try a couple of bottles to make sure, but i cant get there, and the bottom pull or three from each is offensive, cheap tasting as they come, no lager crispness at all, and even with good carbonation this feels off to me, oddly sharp at temperature too, stays on the palate too long, and is just not a very good beer. worse than the original by a considerable margin...",2.38

I have no knowledge of the history of this beer and when it was introduced and if this is even the same recipe but whatever the case this lacks flavor...any flavor...My guess is it may have come out when Minnesota Brewing had the label and probably not a lot went into developing it.

L: clear, sunbeam-yellow hued liquid; near two-finger high cottony white foam builds on the pour and gracefully recedes into a tight, steady cap... as the sips ebb and flow, some thin, frosty bands of lace stick 
 
S: exquisite blend of diaper funk and fresh flower arrangements, hints of fruity marshmallow and peach skin; white wine and berry notes emerge as the foam falls... I could sniff this for days... by the end, before first sip, a peach yogurt scent takes hold 
 
T: considering the aroma journey, I wasn't expecting quite this dry of a base... following a pithy, floral, vinous first contact, peach yogurt briefly flashes, passing with a tart tail, finishing with the fruity essences panning out to the sides of the palate, ultimately leaving a lightly-crackery aftertaste which gradually gets more mineral and leafy, the center opening up and airing out, exposing a lasting spectre of the funky barrel/woody character... that's just the first, palate-attuning sip... second sip on, its delicate notes of fruity breakfast cereal dancing atop outdoorsy, wet-meadow earthiness and a lightly acidic, lightly nutty-yeasty foreground... dry as a mf... I hesitate to say it slightly reminds me of a gueuze, but, it does 
 
F: what can I say?... it coats and caresses my palate with the sultry mist of a summer fling... soft, rosy warmth stoked at the back of the palate... dry, swift, moist feathery-light; on point, effortless 
 
O: again, I hesitate to say... but I believe I enjoyed this more than any RR bottles I've had over the years, which inevitably is going to now make me go back and try a bunch of them... the hop choices here seem astute, but it's a bit difficult to sort out the origin (hops or bugs) of the subtle nuances... my first Le Terroir; good stuff, and it won't be the last (2154)",4.49

Le Terroir,"While I've had 73 ales in this style, I understate the situation and say that I am no fan for Wilds. Of the first 200 Wilds listed by their number of ratings, I've had 22 and only 1 did I rate above the average. 
 
Le Terroir is the second. 
 
Since I am such a sour-puss, I should like sour ales. Only rarely is that pairing made. 
 
But this review is supposed to be about Le Terroir. It Looks better than the competition who often look confused and few are foamy. Terroir Smells like tart fruit. And it Tastes that way; yet its sweet and sour combo has this rare drying sensation that continues. Best yet, it does not interfere with my meal of soup and spinach. Too many Wilds overpower. Terroir stays within itself and treats food as a friend.  
 
I suppose that comes from hiring Rodenbach's brewmaster and the mark he left.  
I've made my micro-review of New Belgium elsewhere and admire the founders who cut their workers into the deal who, in turn, sold the company to a big brand manager. I hope they made the right decision and the creativity of Le Terroir continues.

Clasica,"on draft this really is a league better than its ratings, and for me one of the better straight up lagers we had around spain, of which we had a fair few. neat how every little region seemed to have its own as we traveled through, i love the world of international yellow beer. this one seems cleaner than most, super light bodied and kind of minimal sure, but sometimes these are about what they arent, not what they are, and this isnt metallic, oxidized, cheap tasting, adjunct heavy, or sweet, so its already ahead of many of its peers. it has a nice crispness even if the lager yeast has very little aroma or flavor, and there is balance, even if nobody would ever describe this as hoppy. i have grown to really appreciate freshness in these too, and being close enough to the source for that to be the case was a treat. context can also be everything. we had this beachside on the mediterranean coast with some incredible seafood, red mussels, spicy shrimp, it was primo, so something yellow and cold and bubbly and non offensive was just right. i preferred this to a lot of others because of its tidiness and refreshment value. neat mineral profile makes it kind of earthy, its very dry, and it has some intangibles like head retention that a lot of these done. a pleasing pour, had a couple of them, stands up well to salinity in food and also to spice. better than it gets credit for here on BA.",3.48

Superior,,2.66
Superior,"Poured from the 300mL bellita bottle (which is in fact the same beer as regular bottled superior) this bottle also says its 4.6% not 3.6%. maybe the 3.6% is alcohol by weight. 
 
The look is like any other adjunct lager, has a light head that fizzles down over a few minutes into a few clusters of floating bubbles. Very light not a lot else going on here average carbonation. Crystal clear. 
 
The smell is very vague, with a sweetness and hint of hops but nothing that really stands out.  
 
The taste is similar to the smell, but with a stong corn flavor. No bitterness basically just corn with lager flavor but easy to put down and nothing necessarily offensive. Would be better if it was colder. Right at the front there is a mineral flavor that isnt the best but doesnt really get in the way. Pretty boring. 
 
Feel is denser than you might expect, but still could be a beach beer, but not the best work beer. Maybe good for drinking on a summer night ice cold, but it better be cold. Quite sticky as it warms. 
 
Overall it's a cheap mexican lager with a bit too much corn. Wish it had a bit more gops to balance it out. I suppose balance is the main thing it lacks. All it there is here is corn flavor and I'd appreciate it if there was something more, but if you find it for cheap in the full size I would still give it a try.",2.99

Pours a golden color with a decent fizzy head, nothing on the aroma side but you probably already assumed that.

Aroma: Light wafts of pilsner malt, cracker-like malt, floral hops, and cereal grains 
Taste: Sweet malt and grains come on strong followed by some light but welcome floral notes. Honestly, this didn’t seem like it would be this sweet from what I read from the nose. As that fades, a little corn comes in and finishes with more grains 
Mouthfeel: Light but fairly full, a little cloying from the sweetness, somewhat clean and crisp but the sweetness definitely takes from that 
Overall: Ehh, this isn’t terrible but it’s far from good as that sweetness really detracts from what I assume is coming with a cerveza – crisp, clean, and light. I’d never heard of nor seen this beer so had to try it, and at $2.99/24oz can, it wasn’t an expensive gamble, but I’d grab a Modelo, Bohemia, Victoria, or Tecate every single time over this",2.87

Pours an opaque milky orange with two fingers of airy, whipped egg white-like foam. Retention is fairly decent, leaving a fizzy cap and sudsy, slippery lacing. 
 
Nose is pretty faint but, what there is of it, seems to me sugary, candy-like. Aroma of lemon drops and orange LifeSavers. 
 
Taste is less sweet than expected, drier and more tart. Tasting lemon rind, tangerine and gooseberries. Some astringency standing in for actual legitimate bitterness - but not such that I’d care to complain about it. 
 
Feel is dry and drying, clean and maybe feeling a bit lighter bodied than it really is due to fairly aggressive bright and fizzy carbonation. There’s a mildly acidic and boozy smoulder in the gullet, not unexpected given the abv.

This is definitely your basic Caribbean lager, but served super cold, it’s fine. It’s very crisp with very little flavor, but it’s refreshing. 
 
There are no real off flavors here, and it’s nicely drinkable, with a crisp and clean feel.

Presidente,"Not many pilsners out there with more flavor. Has a pungent after taste that I really enjoy. A cold presidente goes down quick and is hard to beat for refreshment. An underappreciated beer that is great for all day weekend events or if you're drinking regularly in the evenings and want to keep the toll on your beer gut in check. Not the cheapest pilsner, but much more affordable than my shi shi taste in NEIPA'S that are frequently in the $15+ range for a 4pack. Everything a good pilsner should be and a little more. Full Bud is my other go to pils but lacks the bold flavor and international appeal of Presidente!",5

Cerveza Aguila,"This was given to me by a friend who picked it up while on a cruise. He said it was the worst beer ever, but I found it to be a pleasant surprise. Poured from a 473-ml can into a lager flute. Very nice appearance, with a thick snowy white head atop a pale golden colored body. Aromas and flavors of light biscuit and notes of grass, grain, and herbal hops. There is a spicy hop kick on the palate, with some pleasant bitterness and a crisp, dry finish. Light bodied as expected, with a little sweetness that is not at all overpowering. Recommended, if you can find it.",3.81
Cerveza Aguila,"There is a lesson here: that when you chase getting beers from ""countries"" as I have (Columbia is my 63rd), then you are far more likely to end-up drinking beer that is not as good as you like to drink. So it is with Aguila. 
 
There are adjunct lagers that define the style... and then there are those who brew but don't have lots of competition. I suspect Aguila is a product of the latter. 
 
Aguila Looks of average color, but mine is almost non-existent foam. Smells are pleasant (almost a faint hard fruit in there), but then it fades to not much quickly. Tastes are so nondescript that I almost want my money back (but the goal was to get to 63 countries.) Feel is semi-dry like most good AALs, but Aguila is thinner than at least half of the competition . 
 
As for who Barranquilla is and who owns them, that is above my pay scale. Google says they are Columbia's #1 beer because it is ""balanced"" (not too far from my truth) and that it is owned by MillerCoors. Then RateBeer claims Barranquilla (now Bavaria) is owned by AB InBev. Regardless of who owns them, I'm not getting rich off of any of them... or are they elevating my enjoyment.",2.93

Bud Light Lime Peach-A-Rita,"Bud Light Lime Peach-A-Rita brewed by Anheuser-Busch, with an ABV of 8.00%  
This American Malt Liquor pours out a pinkish/ reddish color, with a thin head. This brew pours out of a 25oz can into a pint beer glass. There is a small pink head to this brew, but it goes away fast. The smell is sweet with peaches mixed with alcohol. You pick up on little to none on other beer notes, in this brew. Now for the taste, it is really really sweet. Lots of peach notes mixed with mirror grains and malts. It is really hard to pick up on the 8.00% ABV in this brew, it goes down nice an smooth. If you are looking for a fruity flavored brew , you should look this one up. The body of Bud Light Lime Peach-A-Rita is a solid medium. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, if you like sweet peach flavored drinks. This brew would go nice on a warm day or at a party. The mouth feel is Bold, Sweet, Tart, Smooth and Refreshing. Overall I am going to give Bud Light Lime Peach-A-Rita, a solid 3 out of 5. One of more drinkable A-Ritas on the market. I would look this brew up again giving the opportunity to just to change it up from other run if the mill brews on the market. Anheuser-Busch, did a nice job with this sweet brew.",3

The aroma is all about the alcohol. Putting it up to my nose it smells like vodka. There is some cereal grain in the aroma, however, it's mostly overshadowed by the booze. 
The taste can be described as a sticky, gooey and sweet cereal grain. The alcohol, again vodka, is all over the place. 
The body is medium but as it is tough to get through this one, hard to drink, especially as it warms.

Bud Light Lime Peach-A-Rita,"Poured from the can into a Budweiser pilsner glass. 
 
Quick soda pop fizz is made, making a faint non retention head that dissolves in seconds without a collar. Fairly quiet on carbonation noise when settled, and presents a wild body appearance. The color is a perfect example on the can, a peach orange color, and a pretty good one, it's almost neon like in it's appearance.  
 
Aroma is straight up Del Monte from a can. Fruit cocktail and syrup with quite a bit of sweetness. That seems to be the angle, but it's not really that enjoyable, however a touch of rock salinity makes it a little interesting, but the aroma is a just bit too sweet. 
 
Palate is pretty much like just any other malt-ternative beverage. Sweet sickly alcohol and sticky peach syrup mid flavor palate. Lots of simple sugar like syrup and not much else. Even the salt character isn't coming out as much that was anticipated. While luckily not too booze tasting, it does hit in the gut. Afterwards there is too much Hubba Bubba bubblegum sweetness and flavor, which doesn't even make the beer taste like fruit let alone peaches.

Bud Light Lime Peach-A-Rita,"Welcome to my seCANd as a part of Happy New Is This Beer? Sunday (Week 650). I had purchased this big boy a while back, but when I initially went to review it, an approved pic did not exist. That is a no-no for The CANQuest (tm), so I took the pic, resized it, submitted it & summarily put the CAN in the queue, awaiting the appropriate moment, like today.  
 
From the CAN: ""Malt Beverage with Natural Flavors and Artificial Color"". 
 
This came in one of those mighty 25-fl. oz. tallboy CANs, which are unique in that they seem to fight me on the Crack! Upon acCANplishing this feat of strength that it took to open the dang thing, the resulting noise was like a sonic boom. An inverted Glug was out of the question since a crane was required to lever the cylinder upwards & tilt it into a pouring position. This action produced a brief, fizzy finger of off-white head that quickly reduced itself to wisps. Color was a cloudy Peachy-Orangish shade (SRM = N/A). The lack of clarity was surprising, IMHO. Nose had an odd mustiness to acCANpony the peachy sweetness. Hmm. Mouthfeel was thin & watery & not even all that well carbonated. The taste was really sweet, very artificial, kind of medicinal & while evocative of peaches in some small way, I am not sure that I would have hit upon it without a hint of some stripe. Phew. Plus, it had a fusel alcohol burn that was not helping its cause in any way. I was not really digging what this one had to offer. It felt like liquid headache for later. The unabating sugary sweetness was just not my bag. Previous reviewers mentioned Gummi Bears while another CANtradicted this by saying that it did not even taste like peach CANdy. I CANnot remember what peach CANdy tastes like, but I hope that it does not = this. Phew. Did Minhas relocate to StL, MO? Is a Cyberinvasion imminent? Finish was hot & dry initially, but once the sugary wave took 'hold, it had a lasting sweetness that was unabating. Oh, man. This is beer? Oof.",1.74

Carib Ginger Shandy,"275 mL bottle from a six-pack purchased at the LCBO; best before Aug 2023 and listed at 0.9%. Served slightly chilled. 
 
Pours crystal clear golden-yellow, stirring up a thin layer of bubbly suds that barely qualifies as a head. Within thirty seconds, it has sizzled away, leaving the surface utterly barren - no lace, either. The aroma is sweet, smelling mainly of candied ginger and sugar; not much going on, but it's appealing enough. 
 
The flavour profile is similar - there's no depth whatsoever, but since it's also palatable, I'm not too inclined to complain about a 0.9% shandy lacking complexity. Sugary sweet at the forefront, with notes of ginger spiciness giving way to a sweeter, candied ginger-like flavour on the back end. Maybe a hint of caramelized sugars and grainy malts, but sugary ginger is the main takeaway; the aftertaste is a little sweet. Light in body, with crisp, prickly carbonation that complements its ginger flavours nicely; it's refreshing and effortlessly easy to knock back. 
 
Final Grade: 3.01, a C+. My most common complaint about ginger beers is that they don't have enough of a 'bite' to them, and sadly Carib's Ginger Shandy is no exception. That being said, if I were sitting on a Caribbean beach in the summer, I think I'd be quite content with this very basic ginger beer. It's acceptable, and not much more than that - I might buy another six-pack, mostly because it's nice to have a (functionally) non-alcoholic brew in the back of the fridge for afternoon refreshment... and also because there aren't many other real ginger beers to pick from around here.",3.01

polished-clear, gold liquid; 'foam' disappears in seconds... basically candied/crystallized ginger on the nose... just about the same on the palate - candied ginger, marginally ginger 'beer' aftertaste; mellow-moderate spicy bitterness, however, caramel sweetness holds momentarily before fading away, so it's not too terribly sweetish... somewhat flat in fizz; roundish, but short of viscous... flavorful enough, but also arguably bland; could use a bit more spicy (acidic) zip to achieve more balance with the dull sweet lull; liquid, diluted candy, more alco-pop than beer/malt-bev, more or less (1711)",3.37
Carib Ginger Shandy,"(Original review from October 19, 2004) 
 
I finally tried the ginger version of this. It has a light tan, ginger ale color to it. Some foam forms but it fizzes instantly away like soda. The aroma is sugary sweet and gingery, with a mouthfeel much like ginger ale. The flavor is sweet and gingery. It isn't as intense as a ginger beer, but still has a tiny bit more burn than a ginger ale. The aftertaste has some ginger flavor lingering along with some bready notes (the only beer-llike characteristic I detected. No alcoholic warmth to finish it out. 
 
This is basically alcoholic ginger ale. It was much better than the bright red sorrel version, but it is still more alcopop than beer. I could actually imagine drinking this as a refreshing beverage, unlike the cloying sorrel version.",1.85

Carib Ginger Shandy,"330ml single bottle, procured at my favorite down-market 'bottleshop' in E-town. 
 
This 'beer' pours a clear, pale golden amber colour, with one (I think) finger of fizzy soda-pop 'head', which predictably wisps away just as fast as you can look at it, leaving nothing resembling lace near the glass. 
 
It smells of sharp, edgy, and duly spicy ginger root, middling caramel notes, and a gritty sugarcane sweetness. The taste is much more of the same - rather sweet, syrupy sugar, tinted with a burnt caramel/toffee essence, still perky and peppy natural spicy ginger, an echo of actual indistinct malt, and a mild herbal astringency, very much like those Caribbean bitters. 
 
The bubbles are barely adequate, more like the kind that remain in a bottle of cola left in the fridge for three days, the body a deceptive medium weight, as all that extra sugar has to go somewhere. It finishes well, sweet, in a rather saccharine sense, the ginger holding on, much as it would in the associated soft drink. 
 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is sweet like soda, low alcohol, and yet pretty gingery. This all may be a bit confusing, but I'd take this in a heartbeat over any actual 'ginger ale', as all other things being equal, the minor ABV and heady ginger root notes make this a winner. A winner for Canadian grocery stores, that is, and not as a 'lager beer', as they've so brazenly plastered on the label.",2.44

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's poured a gold to deep golden body beneath a finger's width of white foam. The aroma is sweetish and just lightly grainy; it's obvious that this is an adjunct beer. The hops are as expected: light, non-specific, and in the background. The flavor follows pretty closely. It's lightly sweet and threaded through with delicately spicy and herbal hop notes. There's also a delicate apple-like fruitiness to it. As far as bitterness goes there's just enough to balance it and it teeters on becoming sweet. It finishes with a drop of sweet malt and apple lingering, and then some emerging hops as the malt erodes. The head dropped fairly quickly althought plenty of fine bubbles can be seen rising steadily below. I'd say that's about average, and the lacing follows suit. In the mouth it's medium-light in body and gently crisp. All in all it's not bad for what it is.

Molson Golden,"Molson Golden is perfect beer before Oktoberfest. From when it gets hot, in N. Hemisphere, around memorial day to labor day this beer quenches your thirst, leaves a nice crisp up front flavor then a corn and hop finish. Drink this ice cold in July and August. But when September rolls around it is change to another beer. At middle of September I stock up on Oktoberfests since they are best and seasonal. Granted you can get Molson Golden all year round, and I did get a case of this in winter, but this is a summer beer. I wish Golden was a 5.5 or 5.7 at only 5%abv it is on par with Labatt blue, granted different flavors. This is a typical adjunct lager that is designed to be consumed with speed. This beer reminds me of fishing on 1000 islands in a boat which is illegal in Canada. Good times. I say 3.25 overall but certainly not ""poor"" this is a good beer and deserves respect for being a good macro. I know the men with man buns would argue that IPAs are better blah blah blah, but for an import and being a beginner beer for the 16 to 20 crowd down the tracks, or in the woods this is a tasty beer. I guess the use of corn makes it cheap too but for a Adjunct lager this is what is expected.",3.28
Molson Golden,"Drank ridiculous quantities of this in college in Rochester. Molson dominated there. We used to fill the bed of a pickup truck for bottle returns weekly. While fond memories and nostalgia drive a likely higher-than-deserved rating, I do believe this still tastes okay, and quenches the thirst, on a hot summer day.",3.6

It couldn't be more clear gold. Watery, pale gold. Thin, scattered white foam lace.  
 
Sweet corn and green hop with sour, yesstie aroma all over.

Molson Golden,"Molson beer in Canada is better and different than what gets sent to the USA. It's a bit more hoppy, crisp and very fresh tasting with a some more bite than the US version. Even in the 1980's I had long neck bottles in Montreal and I enjoyed the light taste of Molson.",3.3

Taste is adjunct, basic macro lager, some corn, limited hop character.

No hop bitterness. But a balanced, slightly dry finish. Tastes good. Light but good. Don't taste much in the way of adjunct. Tastes like a light but decent quality lager.

Lots of carbonation. But still soft and pleasant in the mouth. Very satisfying to drink this beer. Goes down smooth and easy. 
 
This is a premium adjunct lager. Similar to what PBR used to be back in the day. I really enjoy drinking this beer. Just wish it was cheaper. Beer got so damn expensive. Its a damn shame.

We have been trying to get a hold of this for the better part of 5 years. For one reason or another, the moose remained loose. We tried ordering it in through Total Wine. No dice. We tried calling the Moosehead rep at a different liquor store. Same result. This was all before the pandemic, meaning no trips to Canada for MD. Finally this summer after two years of no boarder crossing, we brought Moose Light home. It went down like nothing as the boys gathered for a weekend in Maine. The beer was fine. Regular Moose is better, without a doubt. Much more flavor, but moose light, while elusive, was a pretty standard light beer experience.",2.6

Notes via stream of consciousness: Not surprisingly, Moosehead Light tastes a lot like Moosehead, it's just not as rich, nor as hoppy. I'll assume that they're just adding water to lighten it, but it could be more complicated than that. I doubt there's any high-gravity brewing going on that produces more than just one beer though, it's too clean and balanced for that. It's very well made, and the balance that you find in the regular Moosehead remains intact; it's just a little lighter and more refreshing. Of course I still prefer the standard Moosehead, but if I have to have a light beer this is one of my ""go-to"" lights. So let me run through its good points and bad points as compared to the regular. #1, the appearance is not as good. The clear straw-gold body is nice but the head retention and lacing are lacking. #2, the nose is lacking. The beautiful combination of sweetish grainy malt and herbal and floral hops found in the original just isn't there. It's still OK for a light beer, but not nearly as full or bright. #3, just like the aroma, the flavor is watered down (most likely literally). There's some grainy malt which is nice, and some lightly floral and softly herbal hops, but it's not completely satisfying. Again, as a light beer it works, and the cleanliness and balance are impeccable. #4, the finish is good. It remains dry but with some malt and hop character remaining, which is rare for light beers as they usually just disappear from the palate. #5, the body suffers a little bit but not by too much, and the carbonation is gently crisp. It's not too watery. Conclusion: it's at the very least refreshing, I think everyone will give it that, but it's also fairly satisfying - it's like you're drinking a real beer and not some hop-less and almost malt-less carbonated-water. Two thumbs up as far as light beers go!",3.37

Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,"New review, because I was drunk last time. Cool unicorn on the label. 
 
Extra overall marks for the bottle cap. Perfect if you are heading for the field, school or a war zone like me. But it looks totally average inside a glass, great smooth head though. 
 
Aroma is a little unique in terms of the hops...definitely different from a Western European pilsner. Kind of musky and spicy. 
 
Mega unified hops and malt. Subtle sweet hops. I love it. Hops are beautiful, so is the malt. Quite a complex mouth feel with a taste that gradually gets more bitter as it swirls around. Crisp and dry, yet still complex. Definitely tastes best out of the bottle in hot weather. In general for me, Greek food products are the most pure and natural of any country, Cyprus too. The tomatoes and salad in Cyprus are simply amazing. 
 
This tastes much much better straight out of the bottle. Try ; ) 
 
If you want a similar beer that is like this but better, try Efes pilsner. Don't try the Efes draft or malt, they are terrible.

Pours cleanly into a glass with a nice, though short lived head, faint grain aroma, a nice light fizz on the tongue, and a smooth light flavor and clean finish.

The taste is semisweet pale malt with a noticeable sour corn finish. Maybe a hint of oxidation as well. Minimal bitterness. The mouthfeel is thin bodied with above average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Cleanly lagered. Overall, ok.

Old German,"Picked this up from the cheap foods rainbow foods outlet. Big 24 oz can I think. 
 
Pours looking like your standard adjunct lager, straw yellow, fizzy white head 2/5"". Aroma was corn and lager yeast. Little bit of those hydraulic fluid feels that adjunct lagers can get. 
 
Taste, you can tell after the massive carbonation push, is mostly corn, grain and bittering hops to a lesser degree. Its light bodied enough. I dig the German guy on the logo though, I'm sure there is somehow some purple hair gape mouth selfie taker who finds it problematic. Kind of makes me think of this as more of a session like Country Club (malt liquor). Its not ever going to be a go to beer, but sure man, 100 degree weather, I'd crush one of these again in between other beers as a palate cleanser if you will.

Pours a very light yellow with a fizzy, short lasting head. No aroma, and a very weak body. Honestly, if I had tasted this blindfolded, I might have pegged it as a weak tasting cream soda! 
The phrase used as their slogan, ""The world knows no finer"" is no small exaggeration, to be sure. But if you are looking for an inexpensive (ok, CHEAP) beer to have at a cook out, or something similar, this beer would do the trick... but barely.",1.82
Old German,,2.75
Old German,"I found this beer at my local distributor, 15 pack for $9.99. The marketing is nothing special, it's a silly german caricature with a red banner.  
 
Let's be real, this is not gourmet beer, it's a cheap (really cheap) lager you get when you want a buzz without spending more than your spare change. For that class of beer, Old German is actually great. I wasn't expecting much for taste, but it has a decent carbonated hoppy flavor that beats anything Coors or Miller Lite. Personally, I love carbonated beer, so I may have a positive bias for the taste. I will say, though, this beer needs to be ice cold to enjoy. It's not a Bavarian import that tastes good warm, no sir. Put it in the cooler. 
 
The best aspect of this beer, is that it isn't a headache in a can like natural ice or other dirt cheap beers out there. What I'm saying, is that it won't punish you the next day, so long as you don't go overboard.  
Overall, a cheap, decent tasting light beer to go along with throwing football with the pals, or washing your motorcycle. I'd rather have Carlsberg Elephant, but I can't always justify 11 dollars for a six pack.",3.06
Old German,"I had never seen or heard of this before but as soon as I saw a cheap fifteen pack I was hooked. The ridiculous caricature of a Bavarian is probably too stupid to be culturaly insensitive, but its close. Stupidly light color and perfect clarity: this looks like store brand apple juice. Nose doesn't seem to exist. 
 
A little bit of malt sweetness and a respectable bread note. Otherwise kind of watery and blah overcarbonated in the finish, but for the style it is inoffensive and drinkable, if generic and mediocre.",2.95

It was very fizzy, though. Color was a beautiful Golden-Amber (SRM = > 5, < 7) with NE-plus quality clarity. The Gelt Gang of Mammon, Midas and Croesus stopped by for a taste and I used the time to smell it. It had a sweet apple juice/apple cider smell, so I give them points for truth in advertising. Mouthfeel was thin, watery, with a fizziness that I found interesting. It was very much alcopop and no wonder they felt CANpelled to label it as ""Contains Alcohol"" since it would be easy to get carried away with this at 8%. Phew. The taste was unmistakably apple, but it was not as sweet as the nose had led me to expect. We drank a bunch ciders last night, but they were very dry, while this was more semi-dry.

Angkor Beer,"Our first day in Siem Reap, and this stuff is pretty much everywhere. Including the restaurant our tour guide took us to for lunch. In any event... 
 
The beer pours a golden amber color with a frothy white head that quickly subsides. Still, this beer really doesn't look half bad. On the nose, I get canned corn and a bit of grain, and really not much else. Even for an AAL, this is a pretty unimpressive aroma profile. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this lightweight AAL. There's some light sweet corn in the flavor profile, and that's about it. What flavor there is dissipates pretty quickly, and the finish is short, bland and lightly bitter. Mouthfeel is fairly light, with the alcohol all but undetectable. Drinkability is good I guess, if your idea of beer drinking involves uncritical quaffing of a cold beverage while out mowing the lawn.  
 
It gets pretty warm in this part of the world, so I guess a beer as lame and insipid as this is somewhat understandable and even to be expected. As others have pointed out, it's inoffensive, which is probably the best you can say about it.

On the grainy side of the adjunct lager spectrum, but the malt pretty much dies out half way through the taste, leaving the somewhat astringent (possibly just old) hops stark on the tongue. The neutral malt sweetness that usually make this style inoffensive is not present here, this just tastes like a watered down lager.

Sleeman Silver Creek Lager,"Regardless of the name on the label, virtually all of Sleeman's core brands look the same. Silver Creek Lager is no different: light yellow in colour, with an antiseptically clean complexion, and bubbles so plentiful yet entirely ineffective that they must be artificial (they can't sustain a proper head).  
 
There's a certain characteristic that from day one I've noted in all Sleeman products; it's especially prominent in the aroma. It's been many years since I've last had an offering of theirs but I still feel confident I could pick them out in a lineup with other mass-produced domestic brand lagers.  
 
Now I realize it must be the brand of corn syrup they use. This sweet, stenchy, skunky note has an industrial ring to it, a synthetic flavour that is markedly different from the wholesome, toasty graininess of actual malted barley. This taste is more like canned corn kernels and is unpleasant, even off-putting.  
 
The one thing I hear in defense of large commercial breweries is that they're consistent; like McDonalds, their beer taste the same everywhere. You always know what you're getting. To replicate a fermented product like beer to the same standards time and time again on a massive scale isn't easy. This is true.  
 
But who wants to make shitty beer? And who wants to drink shitty beer? I tasted my first Silver Creek Lager over a decade ago and it was just as insipid then as it is now. That's an impressive feat but not one I think worthy of commending. Consistency is a good attribute - quality is a better one.  
 
The folks at Sleeman aren't dummies. They've left this recipe the same for good reason: it sells. This lager may be an injustice to the Czech and German ones that originally inspired it but, sorry to say, its bland, sweet, light-bodied and firmly carbonated qualities are exactly what most consumers look for.",2.48
Sleeman Silver Creek Lager,"A: Golden, light, active carbonation. White head. 
S: Apple, skunk, corn. Mild.  
T: Apple, mild bread, corny. Mild sweetness, pleasant bitterness.  
F: Crisp and bright, but just slightly over carbonated.  
O: Inoffensive but unremarkable. I wouldn't avoid it, but I wouldn't seek it out either.",2.68
Sleeman Silver Creek Lager,"A - Pale straw colour. Good deal of carbonation. Head fades quickly with no real lacing. 
 
S - A slight skunky smell at the beginning, with an apple scent as well. Almost has a cider-like sweet smell, but not in an appealing sense when I'm about to drink a lager. 
 
T - More of the apple like smell, but the taste is fortunately not as sweet. Slightly bitter aftertaste, though no real hop presence. A bit of a musty taste at the very end as well. 
 
F - Carbonation is appropriate for the style. Fairly crisp and refreshing. 
 
O - Overall slightly unimpressed with this one, not that I had overly high expectations. I think I can say this is my least favourite Sleeman product, and I'm not typically a big fan of the company either. I haven't had the Light or the Original Draught in a while, but from what I remember I enjoyed them both slightly more. However, it is still a serviceable lager that could be consumed in large amounts, and the unappealing factors would likely diminish after the first 2 or 3.",2.56

A nice musty, fruity aroma; a very faint touch of horse blanket. A wonderfully balanced flavor of cherry sourness, low-key alcohol, and a touch of earthy woodiness; mild to moderate tartness counterbalanced with a moderate fruit sweetness; a smidge of wheat in the background. Medium body; nice mouth puckering tartness, not too intense and nicely offsets the cherry sweetness.

It’s funny, just last night I had Allagash’s Coolship Cerise, an Americanized Kriek. Now it’s time to have an authentic Belgian version of the style. I’ve been picking up more of these 3 Fonteinen bottles I see on the shelves because they’re pretty much always available for a decent price given what they are, and they never disappoint.

Pours a slightly cloudy ruby red with a finger of pinkish white head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing 
 
The cherries are definitely front and center in the nose, but there’s a malty vibe that makes it feel like a funky pie. I’m picking up on aromas of sour cherry, graham cracker, lemon juice, wet hay, pie crust, apple skin, buttery oak, and light tangerine 
 
It has just as much of a cherry presence in taste, but the tartness is even more focused. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting tart black cherry, sharp oak, wheat bread, vanilla, juicy strawberry, lemon juice, and crabapple. The swallow brings notes of tart black cherry, pie crust, lemon juice, wheat bread, cinnamon, vanilla, sharp oak, wet hay, and light apple skin

Oude Kriek,"Bought at Bottle Craft in San Diego, CA. $18.99 for 12.7 oz bottle. I remember when I first started drinking craft beer, I remember thinking anything over $1 an oz is outrageous. Now that still seems pricy, but not nearly as outrageous. Bottled 6/26/18 consumed 07/04/22. Brought in part to celebrate purchasing my first place and for the holiday. I let it warm to probably ~50F before opening. 
 
A&S: I can see from the inside of the bottle that there is going to be a ton of sediment at the bottom. It will be interesting to see how this changes the different aspects of the beer once poured. Not very lively when opened. Sometimes you get an explosive ""POP"" when uncorking, this was a mild ""plunk"". Without the sediment, the beer is translucent almost opaque crimson red. Over time this color shifts more towards marron. The head is basically nonexistent, although interesting. Only when poured is there head, but the bubble is large and transparent, very unusual looking. A few lazy bubbles of carbonation make their way to the surface. The aroma is surprisingly alcohol forward for being 6.6% ABV 
 
T&M: Initially without much of the sediment, the flavor is super tart. Primarily consisting of under-ripped strawberries and cherries upfront. The flavor stays, but the tartness decreases over time. Semi-dry. The mouthfeel is light and more carbonated than I expected. The taste doesn't linger too long and the beer is not heavy on the tonuge.  
 
Overall: Pricewise this beer is I think worth it for special situations. I really enjoyed it, even with the price consisted. It was a phenomenal example of the lambic - fruit style. Close to being on par with Fou' Foune.",4.43

Purple Haze,"Has a subtle sweet and tart raspberry flavor and one of the most delightful smelling aromas I’ve ever experienced. I first had this beer back in 2005, and it smells and tastes exactly like it did back then, absolutely delicious. While the taste is great, Purple Haze’s downfall comes in its low abv and high ticket price, so it’s a special occasion only beer. I also haven’t seen it in bottles in my area in a long time, at 13 dollars for a 6pk, there really should be a bottle option available.

Purple Haze,Love their TurboDog. Picked up a couple of sixers of this on sale for $6.29 at ABC. Lets give it a whirl. Popping the top I get faint malt wafts. Pours to a deep orange with a creamy off-white head that stands well. Taste is a nice raspberry pop up front then transitions into a malty middle then the bitterness builds in the end and leaves a clingy bitter aftertaste. Not sweet but more tart and bitter at the same time. A good fruity beer for those who still want some nice bitter hopping. I like the fact that it is not sweet and doesn't finish sweet.,3.69

Smells like berries, but not in a lambic way. Boones Farm -ish.

Purple Haze,"DATE: April 14, 2023... OCCASION: watching A Sort of Homecoming with Shan and a beer I hadn't had in a long time.. GLASSWARE: Sam Adams custom lager... a hazy, dirty yellow body streams tiny bubbles upward into an off-white ring... the opening scents are metallic hops, raspberry, blueberry, Smarties chalk, and a strange, funky/yeasty annoyance that nonetheless gives it a unique, memorable aroma... slick, oily, watery--yet refreshingly so... some low-end effervescence at the throat... the strawberry and blueberry are punchy, bright and sweetly interwoven with its bready malts.... at 4% and change, crushable and embracing in its friendship... tough to argue with its effect, it might not be one worthy of an up-close profile, but it will win in the right context or gathering... a nice accompaniment for a warm spring night like this...",3.08

Purple Haze,"Ok so it;s sorta pink - ish in color if back lit. 
It's got a mild raspberry aroma under the malt.  
Hops may or may not have been used in the latter part of the boil.  
Most likely not but... maybe. 
The flavor is light raspberry ale with a bit of actual malt sweetness to give it some ( not much ) body. 
Finish is dry with a tart hint of red berry.",3.41

Hopsecutioner,"one of those beers of fame that i somehow have not had until now, a draft pour, an iconic beer, but it probably meant more when its peer group was smaller. the first thing ive had from terrapin in way too long, nice beer, but in some ways it has a ton of equals now, everyone caught up perhaps. looks like they used to, lightly brassy to copper, mostly clear with some low shine, a fine almost inch of thick and lasting white head, craggy and rocky and leaving lace as it drinks. it smells like minerals from the malt, a little crystal malt richness, but still american, tons of relatively fresh hops wrapped into it, grapefruit for sure, could be simcoe driven, spicy northwestern vibes too, orange zest, cantaloupe, and pine, its resinous and it seems to be bitter, but its not overly intense as they go, at least by todays standards, classically balanced and without anything from the yeast. the flavor is similar, grapefruit for sure, white pine boards, tangerine, herbal bitters, and actual high alpha hop bitterness set against, or rather alongside and together with, slightly nutty pale barley malt, sweet like toffee but for just a flash in the middle, then bready and baked and in a support role. this is really nice, fresh in this instance, and with some linger. it plays in that iconic space, lagunitas ipa and the like, drinkable for its strength and because its got great proportionality, but it also didnt hit me in this day and age as something real special either, good but just an ipa, not being critical, it just seems familiar. good to get to drink some terrapin stuff, i always forget they have corporate ownership now...",3.94
Hopsecutioner,"12 oz. can, best by DEC 07, 2023. Acquired the 6 pack from the Janesville, Wisconsin Woodman's. Ironic how beer brewed in Georgia is available in Wisconsin, yet I never see it in Illinois, but I digress. 
 
A: Pours a nice burnt golden / orange, strong finger point five of frothy sudsy off-white head. Looks float-ish. Color is nice, reminiscent of how they used to make IPA's... 
S: Earthy, twiggy, grassy. Not overly hoppy or piney or resinous, despite the six hop varieties that went into this. Notes of caramel & bready biscuit malt. 
T: The taste is nice, but surely not designed to break or crash any new ground. Bitter, slightly piney, good balance of bread malts. It's simple but nice. 
F: Decent feel. Smooth, creamy. Body feels super light, especially for being over 7% abv, with the alcohol being not noticeable at all. 
 
Overall, I would call it slightly above average, but definitely decent, especially in these days where Hazy swill lines all the shelves.

Arctic Panzer Wolf,"From the bottom of the can: ""PKGD ON 11/18/22 Q0711"" 
This was a 16oz can from a 4-pack. 
 
Appearance: The body is nearly opaque which allows only a very faint haze of a blurry shadow through. It has a deep golden amber body which is on the darker side but not quite bronze. There is a short and fluffy white head which maintains a thin layer of fluffy film over the surface with a creamy and fluffy ring around the glass. There is some spotty lacing. 
 
Aroma: At first some wildflower aroma came through, then some fruity peach and grapefruit came to the nose. There is a touch of cabbage but each time it becomes apparent, it pops out and is replaced by a more fruity aroma. 
 
Taste: The flavor closely mimics the aroma here. There is this somewhat floral opening to the beer giving it a wildflower note up front which is a bit soap-like. Then it develops more citrus character on the tongue; largely this mixture of pithy grapefruit and blood orange. These two citrus notes persist to the end. It has a somewhat grassy finish. After a while some candied orange also comes through a tad. 
 
Mouthfeel: Bitterness on this beer is high. It has a body that is on the lower edge of medium with a touch of slickness. It is a bit of a slow drinker given the high bitterness and the somewhat medium body. 
 
Overall: The citrus notes in this beer and the strong bitterness are the highlights. There is plenty to enjoy when it comes to both of these qualities. The beer also has a floral note which is not bad but when combined with the grassy character it clashes with the more citrus-centric notes of the beer. It's an alright beer but I'm not likely to buy it again over what is readily available on the market. The beer I purchased was consumed within 3 months of being canned so I might try it again if it was on tap or if it was fresher than the one I purchased. I wouldn't advocate for or against it, but I would recommend a single can or a sampler before buying a 4-pack.",3.47

Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,"Sierra Nevada came through with just what the beer Dr. ordered for my jangled nerves. I wholly appreciate how this dank herbal brew is kind of the opposite of so many IPAs on the scene here in the PNW. It has a pretty substantial caramel malty backbone that is distinctive like Rueben’s but less marmalade. The sweetness is mellowed by the bitterness, but it’s not too resinous, thick, but far from watery either. Somehow, this ABV is perfect for a nice buzz but way more sessionable than many IPAs out, maybe that’s a good thing if your planning a hangout outside with your buds. This herbal/malt profile also seems more aligned with this winter season so there’s another positive point. I did get this on tap so I’m not sure if I’d appreciate this as much if it sat around for more than a month and several weeks in the shelves.

Much more like an English brown porter (aside from the bitterness) than most American porters. Roasty notes are low in favor of nutty, bready malts.  
There’s also a thread of that Chico yeastiness throughout.  
What saves it is the body: light and fizzy enough to be sessionable, but with a creaminess that makes it satisfying.  
 
A solid beer, but get Edmund Fitzgerald for that classic American Porter profile.

Porter,"Look: Dark brown, almost black on the pour and deep ruby-red when held to light, with a frothy light tan head that settles slowly, leaving good lacing 
Aroma: Roasted barley, chocolate notes, toasted nuts, warm brown bread, and some earthiness 
Taste: Roast is the highlighted theme here. Tons of roasted barley, nuttiness, and even a light roasted coffee bean note hit hard up front and as those begin to subside, chocolate joins the mix. More roast goodness and earthy notes take hold and lead to the finish 
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, smooth, medium-high carbonation, and smooth but slightly sharp on the finish from either the earthy hops or strong roast notes 
Overall: This is tasty stuff. I hadn’t had this beer in almost two years as only one spot close to me has it in so when I saw bottles dated 10/9/20, I had to revisit and glad I did. A very well-made American porter with deep and rich malt flavors and enough earthy hops to keep it balanced. Throw in the very full body on this as well and you have yourself a winner.

Perpetual IPA,"I'm from Northern California, visiting mother in outside of Philly and thought it would be fun to introduce her to IPAs vs the Leffe (Belgian Abbey) and Pilsner Urquell which she's familiar with.

Cloudy, deep gold colored body. One finger of lingering white, pillowy head. Not much left on the glass for lacing. 
Aroma is grassy and muddy hops, with a sweet note from the maple syrup. Solid malt background. 
Taste is grassy and piney hops, with a sweet note. Approaching a bitter note but not quite. Smooth trail off into the after taste. Allowing the beer to sit on the tongue really brings out the maple and hop combination. 
Mouth feel is the best attribute of the beer, with dense coating and filling of the mouth. Very good carbonation.

Flavor: Strong flavors of rich chocolate some Cany sugar gives a sweet Belgian chocolate and tongue tickle in the middle, before a rich and smooth chocolate finish. Malty and sweet, but then an uprising roasted bitterness ends up lingering. (4.00) 
 
Feel: Heavier-bodied, average to stronger carbonation. Sweet, but then also an uprising of roasted bitterness that lingers. (4.00) 
 
Compared to Bells Expedition Stout 2/2023: Pours similar, lighter head. Similar aromas. More bittersweet chocolate and coffee roast. Less thick and heavy chocolate with complex malt flavors of bread pudding and caramel. More bitter, roasted, and dry.  
 
Overall: A fantastic Russian Imperial Stout. As usual Great Lakes fashion this one packs together a great array of rich chocolate flavors with a rising roasted bitterness. Balance is the name of the game here, and it does it very nicely. 9.9% makes it feel like it's lighter, but make no mistake it's still 10% and incredibly and dangerously drinkable.

Hop Wallop,"Appearance: 
Liquid gold. Pure, clean, and translucent. Looks like an ale you'd expect to see in the tavern of a great dwarven kingdom, just don't drink too deeply, or too greedily. Puffs up a layer of choppy white foam that disappears after introductions are over, living on only as a pattern of sticky, striated lacing. 
 
Bouquet: 
Floral, earthy notes but their aroma is dainty and distant, like flowers far away on a mountain. Traces of dried pine occasionally waft in on that far-off mountain breeze. Pleasant, but falls profoundly short of being impressive. 
 
Feel: 
A cold, babbling brook of bubbles cascade gently on this light-bodied ale. Crisp with a dry, tangy finish that promises to linger but ends up dipping out early. 
 
Taste: 
Bright, semi-sweet pine, quiet notes of pepper, and a wisp of lemongrass all stand before a crackery malt backbone. 
 
Overall: 
Meh? It’s pleasing, refreshing, and there's nothing wrong with it but it’s meek and doesn't add anything new to the genre. A serviceable, middle-of-the-road IPA that'll never stand out but sometimes that's just what the menu calls for.",3.47

Hop Wallop,"Had this several times before my dad gave me a 6-er about two weeks ago. I have one of these left but here are my thoughts now. 
Poured into a tulip, the appearance was a semi-dark yellow branded color with some transparency about it. Some carbonation seem rising at a modest pace. Lace coats in a semi-dusty way but clingy. 
The aroma had a strong citrusy pithy/bitter rind character strolling in for a balance with some bitter piney hop tones. Malts seem barely there. 
The flavor leaned towards the bitter side with a touch of sweet pine dry needles arranging underneath. Mild pine tree aftertaste, fairly dry. 
The mouthfeel was pretty dry running along my tongue. Holding it's own as its scraping like what I remember of old school IPA's/DIPA's. Sturdy carbonation and good for the style. Sure is a sipper. Finishes bitter through dry pine tree notes.dry

Blackout Stout,"12 oz bottle 
Date: 06/11/2019 
Consumed on: 17 Nov, 2022 
Glass: Snifter 
ABV: 9.9% 
Serving Temp: 54.8 F 
 
 
Look:  
Deep and opaque black with a thin tan head. The head dissipates to a ring and a thin film over most of the beer. Lacing is good. 
 
Smell:  
Very rich dark bittersweet chocolate with some notes of dark fruits in the background. Some char (which blends into the chocolate aromas) and faint notes of espresso and black licorice. Some earthy notes are in there as well. 
 
Taste:  
Dark malts and chocolate start things off and then the dark fruits and some molasses (like blackstrap) take over for a short time. The sip really sweetens up with perhaps some brown sugar coming thru. Then the earthy notes and the somewhat bitter char take over, which help bring back some chocolate and also some dark roasted coffee. Things finish bittersweet and roasty and somewhat dry (for an Imperial Stout). The alcohol is fairly well hidden, though not completely. 
 
Feel:  
Smooth and creamy with some warmth from the alcohol. The body is medium. With a slight lean towards medium-full. 
 
Overall:  
A very good (Russian) Imperial Stout. Not overly bitter for the style, this tends towards the sweeter side but not overly much. Very drinkable, and perhaps dangerously so. 
 
This beer has aged well over the 4 years that I have had it. I think that things have smoothed out over that time and blended quite nicely. What does seem to have suffered is the head/carbonation and the body (which is a tad light for my preferences for an RIS). But that's OK. I never found this beer to be overly hoppy/bitter when fresh, so I wasn't sure how it would handle this many years. I can say that it handled that time just fine.",4.02

Blackout Stout,"12oz bottle into a pint glass.  
 
Pours a nice dark color, near black, with a creamy, tan head that reduced to about half a finger for the duration of the drink.

Tastes of cherries with a dark chocolate and coffee finish. Absolutely amazing. Alcohol very well hidden. 
 
Mouthfeel is crisp, yet very smooth, almost creamy, but also almost thin - a nice, balanced in-between. Incredibly enjoyable.

To be honest, I'm not getting much on the nose. It's a fairly faint citrus hop aroma.  
Taste - There's a citrus flavor to this beer due to the hops, and I think it's tangerine that I'm getting from the hops. The flavor from the hops really keeps building in my throat, and on my taste buds. The flavor lingers in my throat, and I just keep tasting it.  
The body is juicy and also has a crisp feeling. The hops linger in my throat, but they don't feel sticky, or like resin.  
This is a delicious example of the style. The aroma was a bit of a let down, it is a bit over a month old, so maybe that plays a factor into it. That being said, the flavor is there.",4.03

Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),"2020 vintage. A very solid and canonical example of the style, perhaps *the* prototype of what a bourbon barrel aged RIS should emulate. I find the style to be a little bit on the roasty, herbaceous side and this was no exception. The barrel aging did smooth things out quite a bit in the flavors, although I was surprised that the mouthfeel wasn't fuller. Overall very glad to finally try this but I definitely prefer Beyond Good and Evil, and their other sweeter BBA stouts

I just got a job offer today, so I needed to pull something out of my cellar to celebrate. I traded a bottle of EH Taylor small batch for this bottle of beer, so let's see if it lives up the hype and $50 I paid for the bourbon. It does look spot on amazing. It's super thick but not syrupy in a bad way. This is the kind of stout that beginners would hate and neck bearded beer nerds crave. On the tongue it's super full and soft. Absolutely perfect for the style for me. I'm not getting enough on the nose though to wow me. I get bourbon and chocolate. I smell the typical lovely bitterness of a RIS. Still, it's lacking in the nose for me. Drinking it though everything lives up to the hype. It's less sweet than a typical Goose BCS which set the standard for me back in the day. I can taste the booziness but in a good way. I like high abv stouts where I can taste the alcohol a bit. Why make a bourbon barrel aged stout if the bourbon isn't front and center? What's different and great is that there's also the balance of the base beer. There's a lot of plain old RIS here. Take your best like a Darkness or Expedition and add the bourbon with everything balancing out perfectly. The finish is long and toasty like a good cup of coffee. A great beer and worth the bourbon (at retail.)",4.56

Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),"Pours a deep, black with a thin mocha-colored head that dissipates quickly. The aroma gives notes of charred oak, bourbon, dark fruits, dark roast coffee, and vanilla. The flavor is less sharp, and more rich with notes of dark chocolate, espresso, chocolate chip cookie, and oaky bourbon and vanilla. The flavor lingers well after the sip with rich, chocolatey cookie flavors. The body is very full and creamy without ever being syrupy, leading to a very balanced finish. Overall, a very flavorful and drinkable beer. One of my favorite BBA Stouts I have ever had, very well balanced flavor and mouthfeel. Highly recommended.",4.6

Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),"2021 Release - Jet black with considerable tan head on an aggressive pour. Smell of bourbon barrel and light char. Taste is incredibly balanced between barrel and chocolate, no burn. Thicker than I expected on the mouthfeel. Classic Hill, world class BA non adjunct stout",4.67
Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),"Bottled on 1/10/2020; consumed on 1/29/2022 
 
Pours an oily midnight-black body capped with a modest finger and a half of dense, pale mocha foam; great head retention leaves a paper-thin veil over an otherwise viscous void along with a large, creamy collar, and the occasional strand of webby lacing dotted around the walls of the glass. 
 
Aroma opens to a healthy barrel char with tinges of ashen smoke advancing to black licorice before finding predominant, nutty bakers chocolate over the middle; dark cocoa is enhanced by subtle caramels as a medley of dark fruits enriches delicately savory, tannic qualities in the backdrop through the close. 
 
Taste brings soft vanillins into black licorice as deep bakers cocoa waves wash over splintery barrel accented with dark fruit esters; whipped milk chocolate decadence on the back end finds spent coffee grounds and hints of bourbon underscoring the finish. 
 
Mouthfeel shows a body on the heavier side of medium and a moderate-low carbonation, purely silky in texture with intensely focused consistency advancing to a creamy mid-palate engaging a rounded, sinewy grit; vaguely tannic leanings into the back end are masked by moderate warmth as a subtle dryness evolves through the finish. 
 
An honest, old-school display of classic Russian imperial stout bittersweetness and borderline acridity, composed in masterful flux with a tame and well-integrated barrel; effortless despite these roastier leanings, this is another example of Hill Farmstead at a formulaic peak in composure.",4.26

Reaction State,"2022 version poured from a 16.9oz bottle into a plastic cup. My day 12 beer for Bottle Logic 12 days of Christmas. Nice thickness. Excellent blend of vanilla, maple and coffee.",4.5
Reaction State,"Cinnamon is becoming my kryptonite so I’m hoping it’s been used with an appropriately light touch in this 500ML bottle, ‘cause I like everything else added to this brute.  
 
Hard black with a few stray brown bubbles that quiet swiftly. Oh Oh. Cinnamon bite is strong on the nose. Please, no, brew deities.  
 
Reaction State tiptoes along the abyss of cinnamon gorge. Cinnamon is straddling the beer but doesn’t quite crush it into submission. Underneath the spice are touches of maple, vanilla, & the ghost of cocoas past. Light bourbon winds its way betwixt & between & the finish is mulled apple cider. Should have split this one with my wife.  
 
Hey brewers: quit putting so much fucking cinnamon in your beers. If you can’t get the balance right, throw the crap away. Pretty good beer, which is sad, as I can sense something really good underneath the cinnamon avalanche.",3.5
Reaction State,,5
Reaction State,"Pours a dark brown like motor oil. Just a half of a finger of dark brown head shows up and disappears just as quickly.  
 
Nose is a walloping of bourbon barrel aged stout. Its got that rich, dense, still wet barrel level of intensity. Huge oak profile. I love it. Next is the roasted malt and a strong presence of chocolate. This reminds me a little of one of my favorites of all time; Weyerbacher's Chocolate Pretzel Sunday Morning Stout. Then in the background, there lies the cinnamon.  
 
Taste is much of the same on the nose. Oak, bourbon, roasted malt, chocolate, cinnamon. But now I get the slight bit of maple syrup. Maple syrup presents almost with, I hesitate to say this, but a sour note when its put in stouts sometimes. Like an extremely subtle tartness or tanginess. It doesn't detract, but it is a unique quality. The tannins from the barrel kind of leave that soapy flavor that also sometimes tends to happen in these barrel aged stouts. Its incredibly mild and doesn't linger, but thats why I decided to put it at a 4.5 rather than 4.75, similar to the nose. 
 
Mouthfeel is fullbodied and smooth. Brief flash of carbonation right at the beginning. ABV makes its presence known, but not as severely as that Maumasi I had the other night. There is a little bit of drying but not harsh on the palate or on the way down.  
 
Overall my favorite Bottle Logic brew so far. I was surprised because I though this was just going to be another ""breakfast stout"", but this one actually blew me away. Well balanced and all the flavors work well with each other and don't feel like novelty additions. Masterclass level stuff.",4.57

Bourbon County Double Barrel Toasted Barrel Stout,"This beer pours a perfect onyx black with zero leakage on the edges and sports a dark tan head that is a bit creamy and sticks around for a surprising amount of time given the 16% ABV. A gorgeous representation of an imperial stout. 
 
The nose is boozy up front, again no surprise with the high ABV, but there’s also huge milk chocolate, caramel, vanilla, oak, and stone fruit (as ripe dark cherries ) notes that literally have me drooling. There’s a LOT packed into this big beer. 
 
The taste has a nice boozy note up front that is not distracting at all, and flows into the milk chocolate, caramel, vanilla, oak, and dark cherry flavors, with a nice warming alcohol note at the back of the palate. This is perfectly balanced and world class at the highest level, IMHO.

Taste is solid, nice chocolate mixed with bourbon and wood notes.

Peche Du Fermier,"Pours bright orange with a foggy transparency. Head is a finger and a half of snow-white foam. A few particulates sit at the bottom of the glass, but not much after pouring the first half of the bottle into the glass. The level of suspended particulate changes when the last 1/5th of the bottle is poured into the glass- it develops a more murky appearance, with visible silt and particulate in the bottom of the glass. Aroma is immediate peaches, but they're soft and delicate. It leans slightly into tart, but is otherwise well balanced thanks to the subtle peach sweetness. Faint cellar stone, oak, and grass occupy the rest of the nose, rounding out the depth. Peaches seem to swell in intensity as the beer warms towards room temperature. Flavor profile leads with peaches again, but leans into tart more so than the nose. It's a pretty quick transition from sweet peach to tart fruits, cellar stone, grass, lemon zest, and soft wood. Front third is fruited, with the back third being all base saison. The middle is a blend of the start and finish. Just like the nose, the peaches swell up in intensity as the beer warms to room temperature, and with that, it brings those underlying tart qualities forward. Still no puckering sourness, but it does create more contrast between tart and non-tart. No puckering or tart finish, with the finale wrapping up with a moderate dryness. Mouth feel is medium in thickness. It nearly falls flat on the tongue, with the initial portion being crisp. Overall, peach addition is wonderful, with the rest of the profile being a steadfast, focused, and balanced saison. It's not overly acidic or tart, providing just enough tartness to offer contrast, without forcing it into sour territory.

S: Big fudgy chocolatey aromas of coconut, cacao, vanilla, hazelnut, even getting some lactose in this. Can sense it's very sweet. 
T: Just as the aroma tells! Brownie/milk chocolate, cacao, coconut hits first followed by some vanilla in the middle and a hazelnut ending. I LOVE this one. This is my favorite bottle logic barrel aged to this day! 
F: Heavy, oily thick bodied, easy to sip. Hides ABV very so well.  
O: This is hard to compare with prairie pirates weekend but man this takes the top spot. My new all time favorite coconut chocolate stout of all time. The reason is because the milk chocolate was there, cacao was there, coconut was there followed by the complexity and thickness of the beer.

Mocha Wednesday,"2021 vintage. Pours a dark brown with lots of flecks of ruby red as the light hits it; pours rather thin with a fizzy cola head that disappears quickly. Bits of carb hitting the surface. No lacing/retention. Nose is roasted coffee beans, molasses, black licorice, loose change, baking chocolate. Very little barrel character, at least initially. Kind of mind-blowing these days to have a chocolate and coffee stout that doesn't lay it on thick with raw adjunct aromas; while the coffee and chocolate are certainly there, they feel like parts of a whole that developed together, rather than some gunk that's thrown in and overpowers the product. Taste follows a similar vein - big coffee roasted coffee bean notes throughout the palate. Through its very long finish, dark chocolate and dark fruit, vanilla, smoky wood, salty black licorice, and finally, traces of warming, spicy bourbon emerge. As on the smell, a really impressive use of the adjuncts here - not at all overpowering, but still present throughout. Mouthfeel is the only real knock for me. The feel is surprisingly thin, and I think a little more body would be nice (and even expected?) given the ABV. Really worth seeking out.",4.37

Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some oak and fudge flavors noticeable too. Good amount of barrel character in both the taste and aroma. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick, rich and a bit creamy with a moderate amount of carbonation. I thought this was a pretty good brew, definitely worth picking up if you're into big barrel aged coffee stouts!",4.49

So here we are, the highest rated American Porter on BA, the legendary Hill Farmstead Everett! This is awesome to finally get my hands on a long time want of mine, not to mention I get the pleasure of trying this just 3 days after canning. Let’s crack it open and find out what all the hype is about 
 
Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of dark tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing 
 
Oh yeah, the nose displays such a wonderful balance between roast and sweetness, I love it. I’m picking up on aromas of medium roast coffee, milk chocolate, brown sugar, earthy hops, raisin, dark toast, light toffee, vanilla, and black pepper 
 
It really upholds the aroma in taste, though maybe a tad less sweet. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting drip coffee, dark bread, brown sugar, honey, milk chocolate, raisin, vanilla, light caramel, and earthy hops. The swallow brings notes of milk chocolate, molasses, medium roast coffee, brown sugar, raisin, dark toast, vanilla, toffee, and earthy hops 
 
A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick yet sharp beer. Finishes bone dry and roasty 
 
This is everything I was hoping it would be. Wonderfully balanced and smooth, yet drinks well under its abv. I’m so glad I ended up getting 8 of these",4.47

Everett,"Thanks to Roy_Hobbs for this one from his strike during NBS BIF #15. 16oz can (dated 5/18/21) Poured into 16oz tulip. Poured the expected dense, nearly solid, black color with about an inch of tan head head that had decent retention and lacing. 
 
The aroma had a solid, but not overpowering, amount of roast at the front of the nose, backed with solid grains, and just a bit of floral hops. 
 
Similar on the tongue, a good blend of grain, roast, and soft, slightly grassy, hops. 
 
The body was also about typical for the style, perhaps a touch fuller than usual, smooth, and had a dry, roasty finish that lingered. 
 
Drinkability was very good, a nice sipper, and an easy quaffer at the same time.

Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,"Bottom line: this is a delectable pastry stout worthy of Angry Chair's lofty reputation. They simply seem to have mastered some sort of alchemy regarding the style that few, if any, can match. 
 
It's perhaps not a dead ringer for the namesake dessert ... but it honestly isn't far off, and the resemblance grows with successive sips. It's sweet, but not cloying; realistically, it's more rich and decadent than sweet. The coconut is a lovely light touch, never overbearing, but adding another layer to the profile. Chocolate and vanilla are prominent, joined by molasses, cherry, and caramel from the malt base. Incredibly long finish, including lingering notes of coffee, chocolate, and vanilla. 
 
This is another absolute home run from Angry Chair. Every single time I have one of their highest-rated pastry stouts, I think there's absolutely no way it can possibly live up to the hype ... and then it not only matches, but surpasses the hype.",4.46

Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,"From a 32oz crowler, filled at the brewery 06/03/23. Served in a tulip. 
 
Pours a thick-and-viscous appearing motor oil black. A scant quarter-finger of coffee-colored suds lasts a half-minute or so, leaving a soft, creamy collar and a barely rousable oily, sugary film of super-slippery lacing. 
 
Nose is roasty-malty, nutty and mildly sweet. Aromas of fudge and dark roast coffee. Some nuttiness and woody, husky coconut as it warms. 
 
Taste is fudgy-sweet - but much less sweetness than anticipated. Tasting brown sugar chocolate vanilla fudge, molasses-sweetened coffee and - more prominently and notably as the beer warms - an earthy, woody nuttiness, ground bitter walnut, thick and heavy perfumy vanilla and husky coconut. Nice! Alcohol is hardly noticeable. 
 
Feel is smooth and viscous, dense but less thick and heavy than it appeared going into the glass! with super-fine, prickly carbonation making it feel a little lighter than it might otherwise. I want to say that it feels ‘sugary,’ like sugar water but that’s totally hallucinatory - it tastes like it should feel sugary but it does not. Abv is hardly evident. 
 
Overall, outstanding! I like to buy these sweet and sticky pastry stouts mainly so that I can complain about them and leave bad reviews but this was so damn good that I was wishing I hadn’t offered to share it with Boy and Spouse. Mammosilenus, who never likes stouts, stole several ounces of this and then came back looking for more and had to be beaten back.",4.42

A: Pours with a near opaque cloudiness. A dense white head rises with good retention and lace. Manageable to pour if you go slow. 
S: Some sweet fruits, most people are saying pineapple. Sure, I guess I can go with that. I don't know if these kinds of NEIPA's overwhelm me to a point were I just can't pick anything out, cause I don't get near the expressive fruity/hops aromas as others. Its just vaguely there.

M/O: I guess I can't be too hard, but just muddled to me. Low carbonation, sticky sweet, no finish, some kind of astringency. Either from hop burn or alcohol burn. This is going to be a chore to finish.

Pours dark black, zero carbonation. Strong pleasant aroma of chocolate and molasses. Taste is much of the same with an added hint of coffee and bourbon barrel.

Barrel-Aged Silhouette,"Lift Bridge Silhouette Barrel Aged Imperial Stout. 2014. Bottle Number 239. 750 ml. 1 Pint, 9.4 fluid ounces. Alc. 10% by Volume. Aged in bourbon barrels. Brewed and bottled by Lift Bridge Brewing Company in Stillwater, MN, USA. ""The Cold War is over. Serve at 55-60. Degrees. (I still don't know the key for that one.) I will skip the the gobbledygook until later. 
 
(Note: this is one of those very rare occasions when I don't have a photo of the beer I consumed to go along with the notes. I plugged in the iPod touch that use to take them and found nothing. How is this possible? It's part of my regular routine, I never forget to take the pictures. Could I have accidentally deleted them somehow? That's even less likely. Perhaps I was just so excited to drink the beer that I forgot to take that essential early step in my ritual. So, once I realized there were no photos, I fished the empty bottle out of the recycling, and posed it next to the as yet un-washed glass I drank it from. That's not even the true beer in there, I followed Silhouette with another bottle. 
 
 
I bought this two weeks ago at the brewery. Wish I had another to save and age and savor in the future, but this is the one, and I'm drinking it now. (I'd actually never even heard of this beer, must have been sleeping or something when it was released last year.) 
 
 
Solid blackness in this one (the darkest beer I've had from this brewery), with a rich, roast tan head that starts big, slims down and stays awhile. 
 
Aroma leaps out and spills the bourbon all over the place. Additional notes of charcoal, molasses, caramel, toffee, dark fruit, …vanilla. Always vanilla. And I like it. 
 
Taste: Ah, mmm, and yeah, huh. Deepness and richness in abundance. This has got everything it needs and it lasts and lasts. Immensely indulgent. Chocolate and espresso and everything dark and deep and delicious. MMM, I'll say it again. And what else? Licorice. We call it anise sometimes. And all those other things. 
 
It's a thing of hugeness and a richness and wonderfully rewarding to the drinker. this is all relative. I am loving this and this is not a chore at all, it is a delight. If you want to read about a chore, check my review of Stone's Crime and Punishment. Yikes, talk about trial and error! 
 
Hey, let's read the gobbledygook. ""Silhouette is as deep and dark as the Northern woods. It's brewed in the style of an Imperial Stout. Aromas of coffee, chocolate, molasses and prune meld with a unique dark roasted character. . The beer is complex, rich and full bodied. It's wild spirit will warm the senses, illuminate the soul, and grow into a traditional favorite…no matter what season.""",4.4
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,"2020 bottling, 12 oz bottle. 
 
I walked on by this beer many times in the store because I considered it to be overpriced (yeah, I know... it's a ""99 World-Class"" here, but we're suckers for a BA Imperial stout...). 
 
Anyhow, in a weak moment, I did order one from my favorite curb-side pickup store a while back, and it sat in my 'fridge, and sat, until I finally moved it to the cellar to make room for other beers.  
 
It's back in the refrigerator for Cellaruary. 
 
So, today is the day. I won't be able to compare it to the beer fresh, though, since this is my first tasting of this beer. 
 
Taken from a ~42° refrigerator and allowed to warm for 30 minutes or so unopened. Drinking started at mid-50°'s (a guess). 
 
Opaque black topped by a ½ inch creamy-appearing dark tan head with short retention. Little visible carbonation and what lacing does appear with a tip of the glass quickly slides back down into the tan ring. The ring eventually disappears completely, leaving a still surface. 
 
Very strong aroma. Bourbon first, then barrel. Molasses. Slight hint of vanilla. 
 
Rich flavor, mirroring the aroma. Bourbon, oak, vanilla, sweet molasses. Adding to the party is roasted malts and dark fruits. Toward the finish and into the aftertaste, dark chocolate appears along with the alcohol, slightly warming my mouth in the after. The finish is sweet vanilla and dark chocolate. 
 
The body is substantial, approaching viscous (but not quite getting there). 
 
Overall, this BA stout is excellent, indeed. A rich aroma and flavor, a substantial body, lots of bourbon and barrel without overpowering the underlying Imperial stout flavors, a sweet, but controlled sweetness, finish. It's not a dessert beer, but an excellent evening sipping beer. If I'm feeling like splurging, I may actually buy it again!",4.45

Double Stack,"Double Stack from Great Notion. 16 fl oz can from @snaotheus in NBW BIF 17. Reviewed 14/05/23 (Review 3101). Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol. 
Top rim of can stamped “STICKY STACKS 03.06.23”. Stored at 34 degrees at home. Served at 46.2 degrees F in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 54.5 degrees F.  
Appearance – 4.25  
First pour – Amber Brown (SRM 18), clear. 
Body – Black (SRM 40), opaque. Under direct light, same. When rear lite, opaque with light penetration at the edges – ruby. 
Head: Average (Maximum 1.1 cm, aggressive center pour), tan, high density, quickly diminishing, reducing to a 0.2 cm crown constantly renewed by carbonation, and a thin partial cap.  
Lacing – Poor. Thin line of near-microscopic bubbles. 
Aroma – 4.5 – When the tab is popped, instant aroma of coffee and maple syrup! Weak roasted malt, no hops, no yeast. No ethanol (11 % ABV as marked on the label).  
Flavor – 3.5 – Moderately bitter coffee with maple syrup flavor as backing. Bitterness enhanced by the char flavor. No malt, no yeast, no hops. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Slight gastric warming.  
Palate – 4 – Medium; watery short of syrupy/creamy; soft carbonation. 
Final impression and summation: 4 Without the char bitterness, I would have rated the flavor 4.5; for my taste buds, the char nearly ruined the maple/coffee combo. Otherwise, this is a very good coffee stout. And that “natural flavor and caramel color” screams “Unnecessary crap added”.",3.94

Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of creamy dark tan head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing 
 
This is absolutely a maple bomb in the nose, but the coffee plays a nice supporting role as well. I'm picking up on aromas of maple syrup, milk chocolate, burnt caramel, medium roast coffee, vanilla, brown sugar, and straight up pancakes 
 
It's surprisingly much more bitter in taste compared to the nose, not to say that it's super bitter but it has a nice bite. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting raw maple, dark roast coffee, charred malt, vanilla, cocoa powder, molasses, light raisin, and brown sugar. The swallow brings notes of maple syrup, dark roast coffee, cacao nibs, burnt caramel, charred malt, dark toast, and light molasses 
 
A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a sweet beer with a bite. Finishes a tad sticky but nothing that hurts the drinkability

Double Stack,"Can poured into a Mountain Rambler Brewery snifter 
 
A: Pours basically black with a frothy tan brown head that settles to a thin layer and leaves some thin lacing. 
 
S: Opening the can is like opening the door to a sugar shack as you're met with a wave of maple, followed by bold coffee, roasty malt, a little char, and faint smoke, light earthy notes, chocolate, vanilla, toffee, and slightly toasty biscuity bready pancake-y-ness. 
 
T: Opens with a huge hit of maple syrup, followed by milk chocolate, vanilla, and a nice touch of coffee that leads into roasty malt, a little char, and a touch of smoke, with underlying mild earthy and slightly nutty notes, toffee, and toasty biscuity/bready malt very reminiscent indeed of a stack of pancakes. 
 
M: Full body, somewhat mild carbonation, pretty smooth though somehow I would describe it as especially creamy, alcohol is rather well hidden giving just the slightest touch of warmth as it comes up to room temp. 
 
O: I've had a couple cans of this sitting in the fridge for a few years now, just waiting for the right night to crack into my special liquid souvenirs from a great road trip. But as time passed and that night never came, I got on the lookout for a fresh can to purposely do the opposite with; to push to the front of the line as quickly as possible and try fresh. A lucky shipment of cans hit my area recently, so here we are, cracking into a can that's a little more than a month old.  
 
This beer probably has the strongest maple presence of any beer I've ever had, including CBS. To their credit, you definitely get the sensation of taking a big bite of pancakes dripping with syrup after just taking a sip of your morning mocha. Unfortunately, that kinda leads into its downfall. While it is true to their own description of having an ""extreme maple syrup flavor"", it can come off as ungodly sweet up front. Not gonna lie, I'm also a little weary of the label saying ""coffee, maple syrup, natural flavor, and caramel color"", potentially meaning there's some kinda maple or 'pancake extract' in there. This one is fun to try, but could really benefit from some balance; upping the coffee, backing the maple down a notch, maybe even both would help make it less of a novelty and more of an enjoyable sipper you go back to. Maybe some age will do the trick. I'll definitely update when that right night comes along and I get into my vintage cans. For now, I'd say it's a cool one to try as a short pour, but it can get overwhelming in greater volumes.",4.19

Not quite clear amber body with an active champagne fist receding to a small fine cap. Vague, sloppy lacing; no legs. Very good retention. 
 
Subtle yet complex aroma - herbaceous and floral with a delicate funk bringing to mind superior washed rind cheese. 
 
Palate entry brings to mind alfalfa fields, sorrel, and salty sea breezes. Tart but not bracingly so. Low earthy bitterness comes and goes. Goat milk, lanolin, crisp malt, and raw nuts. Finishes dry with earth, minerality, umami, and a hint of funk.  
 
Medium-light bodied, well carbonated, nearly refreshing, but still soft.  
 
Hard to find a more authentic example of the style - rich, complex, rustic yet refined. Reasonable value given the time and labor involved. A good candidate for aging indefinitely.",4.5

Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,"Pours a rich, light orange with ample visible carbonation and a light collar of foam. Nose is extremely funky and expressive with elements of dried and wet hay, fresh cut crash, menthol, wood chips, pine, and sap. The aroma continually evolves and builds on itself throughout the course of the drink. Taste follows with an equal complexity and expresses many of those notes from the nose. There's a deep earthiness that underlies it as well, evocative at one moment of the smells of a forest floor or the flavor of a cave aged cheese the next. Overall, this beer does not stop working until it's gone. Remarkable and easily one of the best.",4.75

Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,"Poured from an undated 24oz can. Also does anybody actually know who owns this brand? 
 
On the pour a quite surprising 4 finger, albiet quite fizzy, white head that dissipates down to 2 fingers after a couple minutes. Color is your standard golden yellow straw, and carbonation is fine but active. Some lacing  
 
Smell is generically cheap. Light and dominated by mistreated lager yeast. Not the most disgusting thing, and honestly quite bright smelling, but still not good by any means. 
 
Taste is syrupy and odd. Diacetyl is present and the ""malt"" is intensely sweet and syrupy. There is some actual barley present but it's hiding in the very back. Slightly Metallic as well. 
 
Feel is mouth coating and weirdly flat. Maybe this is an old can but there is still carbonation. Maybe the liquid just chemically couldn't hold carbonation well. Medium long finish that I wish was shorter. 
 
This is a disgrace to market as a pilsner. Once G. Heileman moved out of La Crosse and City Brewing took over just figuring out who owns what, and even what beer comes out of that brewery is a nightmare. About the only good City brewing beer I've had was montucky cold snacks and that was just a decent lager. This on the other hand is a cheap disgrace. I'd rather drink colt 45. And to be honest with you the lost lake website says this is higher ABV but I'm not sure if it's a typo because the listed abv is the same as the Ice version, and it really seems like they just don't care.",2.39

Amigos,"11.15 fl oz bottle, BBE FEB 2013. I'm not scared. Found a single bottle of this on the floor at the local bottle shop. Got it for 99 cents. 'Cerveza Especial'. 'Product of the UK' - not what you'd expect to read on what appears to be a Mexican style lager. Label lists a 6.00% abv. 
 
Poured into a Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale mini snifter. 
 
A - Pours a standard dark golden body; the same as it appears through the clear glass bottle. Conjures hardly anything for a head, merely a quarter inch of white froth that falls to a thin ring quickly. Appears aptly carbonated, but has no real head. Some thin sticky scattered random lacing when given a nice swirl. 
 
S - Aroma is where this one loses me. It's not typical of a lager or a malt liquor or a light beer for that matter. Has a bit of faint dusty bready malt sweetness, with some vague notions of citrus fruit / citrus peel, probably lime or lemon.  
 
T - Taste is extremely sweet & syrupy, with a hint of lemon-lime tartness that is actually quite nice. Definitely over the top sweetness dominates this one, with the citrus flavors coming in second. It's not awful, but it's certainly not complex stuff. 
 
M - Feel is smooth & sweet. Easy-drinking; definitely doesn't feel like 6.00% abv. Needs better carbonation. 
 
Overall, this was probably an old as hell bottle, so I will do my best to try this one again fresh. Until then, we'll just call it interesting.

Aroma is immediately noticeable on opening the bottle and pouring, a strong fruity and agave (tequila), citrus smell, malt is subdued. Flavor is watery tequila, lime, Sprite citrus, sweet. Light bodied. Apparently an import to compete with the light fruit beers and drinks, this does not taste much like beer. A faint hint of malt, but really tastes almost exactly like a left over tequila and Sprite drink from last night with melted ice cubes. Not familiar with this style, but it's not for me.",2.49

Amigos,"A 500ml clear glass bottle with a BB of Sept 2014. Acquired a while back from a supermarket. Described as a tequila flavoured beer allegedly created in honour of the Aztec god Huehuecoyotl. Inspiring... 
 
Poured into a straight pint glass. A clear golden colour with good carbonation. Forms a smallish head of white foam that lasts for a moment before dissipating. Aroma of sweet artificial fruits and sugar with vague hints of lime, weak malt and a whisper of stewed leaves. Decidedly subpar. 
 
Tastes like an artificial fruit cocktail with a sweet finish. Notes of lime, juicyfruits, sugar/sweetener, faint malt, weak stewed leaves and a harsh quality in the background. Little bitterness to speak of, but a touch of acrid cardboard upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is smooth and tingly, with prickly carbonation and a thin, watery body. Mildly astringent, followed by an aftertaste of lime cocktail, sweetener and harsh stewed leaves. 
 
Blech - not much of a beer. Looks pretty normal, however the aroma and flavour possess a cloying sweetness and fake fruit notes that jar the senses. Insipid body. A fairly unpleasant experience, at least for anyone with functioning tastebuds. One to avoid.",2.52

Amigos,"Found this bottle in Manhattan, KS. I thought it was a typical Mexican lager, but closer inspection revealed it to be from the UK. Further inspection of the ingredients led me to the discovery that they put sugar, flavor and citric acid in it. All of those ingredients make it taste like a corona that has already had a lime added to it. Or possible like a Miller Chill. It's fizzy and works okay with tacos but it was just not my thing.",1.69

""Naturally brewed pilsner beer."" 
 
Off the first sip, I'm calling bullshit on the ""pilsner"" designation. This is very clearly an adjunct lager...it's immediately obvious.  
 
A biteen syrupy. Driven by a deeply off-putting creamed corn sweetness. Cheap 6-row lends more generic malt sweetness. 
 
A bit metallic. Certainly too sweet. Lacks any balancing hop character. 
 
I won't get into its lack of any Noble hop character or pilsner malt since it'd be disingenuous...it ain't a pilsner, it's a budget adjunct lager. 
 
But even as a budget adjunct lager it's pretty bad, to be honest. I often find myself defending the Coors Banquets and Miller High Lifes of the world, but I can offer no such effort with respect to this...it's bad and generic, with obvious imbalance and no redeeming characteristics.  
 
Even on a budget beer basis, it comes up short against Ballantine XXX, the less repungant malt liquors, and many mainstream adjunct lagers (Schlitz Gusto, Coors Banquet, Rolling Rock, Miller High Life, hell even Budweiser - yes, I said it). 
 
This is in that weird market segment of budget lagers brewed by generic sounding corporate conglomerates by shell companies in Wisconsin (this one is ""brewed"" by ""Universal Sales, Inc., La Crosse, WI"" - I'm sure that's a down-home operation run by passionate former homebrewers...), and even in that unenviable cohort it's a loser of a beer. 
 
I feel like I need to wear a wifebeater and have a ball game on (with maybe some casual child abusing thrown in) to be able to ""appreciate"" this beer.

Made with natural ingredients?!? When has a beer, other than a Minhas product, been made with unnatural ingredients?!? This does NOT bode well! 
 
I Crack!ed open the vent & held my breath, hoping for the best but girding for the worst. The Glug revealed a gorgeous Golden-Amber colored (SRM = > 5, < 7) beer with NE-quality clarity, calling forth The Gelt Gang of Midas, Mammon & Croesus for a taste. They had to wait until the just-better-than-a-finger of dense, foamy, rocky, bone-white had subsided to get at it. Nose was not bad, kinda grainy trending towards wheat, but seemingly adjunct-free. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium, mere steps above wateriness. The taste was just too sweet, but not metallic or adjunct-ridden. What?!?

Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,"Look - Ok, to be honest... my rating of the look is not very objective. I know this beer well, yet, I bought a 24 oz. can (for $1.15, nonetheless) just to have a fresh take on the review, but having had this before, when I pour it out, it looks kind of like they bottled the urine of a dehydrated 95 year old man. 
 
Smell - Trying to be a little objective here. Smells sweeter than I'd like, lots of mixed in adjunct aromas. A little bit of malt. 
 
Taste - Not the worst beer I've ever had, but definitely on the low end. It tastes kinda like an anxiety attack... Ok, it's not that bad. The flavor on the initial draw into the mouth isn't that different from a macro American Adjunct Lager, but the lingering flavors and aftertaste seem more like the metallic powder used to exacerbate the yeild of high explosives... Ok, it's not that bad. 
 
Feel - Light and watery. 
 
Overall - Yes, I have been heavy handed in this review, but do not let that scare you away from this beer. This beer holds a special place in my heart. It is what I call a ""Party Beer"" (but not a frat party beer). This is the kind of beer that the college guy in the studio apartment buys for a party because he's very poor (yeah, that was me). It's not great, but it is serviceable when needed.

It's not in the same category as an expensive German pilsner, and so can't be judged the same way. This beer is a cheap American beer. It's not pretending to be anything else. It's a drunkard's beer, and it's one of the best drunkard beers on the planet, IMO. If you wanna get wasted, and fast, this is the beer for you. One caveat: if you drink it too fast (too many in a row, too quickly), it will make you sick. The alcohol in this beer sneaks up on you, and when it hits it hits hard. Drink one, wait a few/ten minutes, then drink another. If you wanna get drunk, you won't be disappointed. And for all those people pouring this beer into a glass and complaining about the head/aroma: Again, you don't understand. This is not a pour-beer - it's a drink-from-the-can beer. It's the beer you drink while watching Winter's Bone. Or after your girlfriend dumped you. Or your dad died. Or you killed someone, or life just sucks and you wanna get wasted.

Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),"Ahhhh, the vaulted (approximately) $0.85 IIPA offering at the world famous watering hole: Trader Joe's. Expectations set to overly critical, thumbs set to overdrive. Here we go: 
 
There's a number of bad reviews of this beer here on Beer Advocate, and yes, I completely see where most of them are coming from. I mean really - is this REALLY a IIPA?? Where's the citrus? Where's the pine? Where's that gorgeous gorgeous (it says 75 IBUs on the can, but I'm guessing that's a typo) bitterness? Other than the ABV, an IIPA this is not. 
 
And a Belgian? It's not even that great a Belgian! Sure it's got the sweetness, and maybe it could (barely) pass the mouthful test, but where's the dark fruit complexity? Where's the depth? Where's the hooded monks slaving over a barrel of dark, sumptuous, gloriously syrupy ale? A Belgian it clearly is not. 
 
So then, what is this monstrosity of a (about) $0.85 per can beverage? What is it? And why did I just score it 4? 
 
Boatswain Double IPA, 8.4%, poured from can into a clear double-sided microwave and dishwasher safe coffee mug from Costco. 
 
L: It says ""Appearance- Deep Amber"" in all caps on the can. It's not the deepest of amber I've ever seen on a beer, but it's not in ""this is false advertising"" territory either. This is a pretty heavy pour - just-finished-assembling-some-furniture-and-I-want-a-beer-quick type pour. It's got quite a bit of a head that dissipates in a fair amount of time. There is lacing on the glass, so that's a plus. Under the light it's, like I said, not the deepest of amber. It's cloudy, with the lightest of fizz. It's not bad for what it is - and it's a... 
 
S: Oooooooh. Sweeeet. Like peach and biscuits and a little vanilla. It's malty - you can smell the sweet molasses-ey maltiness of this. It's almost like a... 
 
T: Malt. Malt. Malt. Malt sweetness hits first. I'm guessing they use a fair amount of crystal malt. There's a very slight hint of that peach, a little banana, and a little bit of that sweet vanilla that hits too. There's a little hint of that hop bitterness, it's there. More pine than citrus, not overly complex. And then there's the aftertaste. I'm writing like that's a bad thing - it's not. It's pleasant, honey sweet maybe? And it lingers for a bit. I like it, personally. All things considered, it's a pretty straightforward ale - malt biscuit sweet with enough bitterness to balance it out. A complete letdown as an IIPA, but it's pretty good as a... 
 
F: I'm nearly at the end of this glass. Relishing every last drop to fill this review in. Maybe one mouthful left. Instantly regretting letting my wife try some, but hey, a shared beer is a good beer. It's syrupy, like a honey lemon drink made by someone with one too many pots of honey in their kitchen. And it lingers too - in your mouth and on your lips. It clings to your throat and sinuses. Or that's just the weather talking. It's thick, and glossy, and what you'd expect from a... 
 
Malt liquor. Actually more like a double amber ale. I mean it's got everything an amber would have but, like, doubled. I actually like my British style ambers with their sweet malt biscuitiness and their simplicity. And I like this beer. As an amber, it does exactly what you'd expect and a little more, and as a malt liquor, you get a complexity that very few $0.85 (about) a can a beer can get you. It's easy to drink, it's accessible, it's all-round pretty good. And I'd probably get a few more. Once I get over the expected hangover. 
 
TLDR: It's less than a dollar bought at Trader Joe's. It's not Chimay, or Pliny, or whatever IIPA is in fashion. But it's not Kingfisher Strong, or Red Horse, or some bottom shelf nonsense. It's a good, marginally complex ale that I'd recommend to new drinkers who'd like to try something different.",3.89

It tastes like a Belgian ale trying really, really hard to be an Imperial IPA- and not a great Belgian either, too thin to be a Belgian. Almost no bitterness. Not a lot of complexity in the flavors here. Could be improved by picking, once and for all, what this beer wants to do with its life, and then either adding citrus peel to make it more Belgiany or more hops to make it more Imperial. It does not taste double hopped, but it definitely hits like a double IPA at 8.4%, while also being five bucks a 6-pack at Trader Joe's... so, that does sway my review here. If it were any more expensive or tasted any worse, I'd say it's not worth it.

Now you have a Corona on steroids just don’t pore in a clear glass. Lol,1.82
Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),"nice amber color, but the head is massive loose bubbles like root beer or cola that lasts maybe 1 minute. no lacing. overtly malty smell and taste. unremarkable mouthfeel. much more like a badly executed Belgian than any kind of IPA. My wife called it disgusting.",2.82
Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),"Overall; This beer reminds me a lot of Pyramid brewing's Outburst IPA. A dominating sweet malt bill. Nothing citrusy about the European type hops. Along with a high ABV. If you like Outburst you will like this beer. Very much a 90's type beer...  
 
12 Oz can. No package date. Poured into a pint glass 
 
Pours a light orange/honey colored body with a white head. Not much retention. A few rings of speck lacing. 
 
Nose is very understated. I'm getting sweet malt with a tiny whiff of German style hops.  
 
Taste is very reminiscent of Pyramid brewing's Outburst IPA. Hops under the radar along with a dominating sweet malt bill 
 
Feel is appropriate for the style.

Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),"It literally tastes like how a BandAid smells. You KNOW what I'm talking about here. Rubber and cotton and adhesive.  
 
I jumped on this at TJ's today -- a double IPA for $4.99? Sure, sign me up! The amber color of my first pour was surprising, as was the nose -- rubber and alcohol. But the taste is what put this over the edge -- sweet and malty -- not anything like any double IPAs I've ever tried. Downright nasty, actually. It has an 8.4% ABV, which is great and all -- if you can stomach this abomination...I can't. 
 
Even at this price point, I'm never doing this again.",1.61

Aroma is of moldy broccoli, stewed beets, and mango puree.  
 
The initial/base flavor is really awful, like used chewing tobacco, but it's entirely grainy. Then a nice mango flavor comes in - whether it's artificial or real, I guess it doesn't matter, because it takes over the nasty flavor so it's a welcome arrival. The finish is of mango/grapefruit lozenge. A general rotten flavor sustains throughout the profile. 
 
Feel is nonexistent. Just very thin, empty. Clean though. Nice carbonation. Light chalkiness. 
 
Overall, much less impressive than the Berry flavor. I didn't like this one at all.",2.23

12 fl. oz. clear glass bottle. Ink Jet packaging information is worn and illegible. 
$2 @ Weis, Conshohocken, PA 
 
The label for Pittsburgh Brewing Co.'s I.C. Light mango is basically the recipe: it's I.C. Light with ""NATURAL FLAVORS AND ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS"" added. That sound a little bit harsh, but it actually gives it pleasant, and surprisingly realistic mango flavor. The only surprise is that it's also lightly skunked ~ and I'm assuming it's only lightly skunked because there aren't that many hops in there to begin with. Still, it doesn't come across as ""sweet"", even with the additional sweeteners. It's an interesting and enjoyable light beer that would be perfect for summer, and at just 3.8% ABV you could drink a few if you wanted to. A very good entry into the fruited light beer category.",3.12

Appearance: light golden hue with no haze and a ton of effervescence. Head is a finger of white foam that dissipated quickly. 
 
Smell: malty and grainy, with a rather a bit of adjunct character. Not awful, but not great either. 
 
Taste: adjuncts, malt, almost a little sourness. Honestly it’s not wonderful. 
 
Mouthfeel: medium-light body with a reasonable carbonation. Not really creamy, but it’s fine. 
 
Overall: there are worse macro lagers out there, but this isn’t a wonderful beer.",2.55
Carta Blanca,"Poured from a 32oz bottle best by Apr 2023 
 
On the pour a 3 finger white head forms with some light fizziness. After a while the head dissipates to a more fizzy rocky 1 finger head. Fine plentiful carbonation in a golden yellow body. For the style head retention is pretty nice. 
 
Aroma is old and almost skunky in the hops. Corn is present and lager character is quite present. A very ""mexican"" import aroma. Despite that it is full bodied while maintaining a lighter and refreshing presence. High carbonation while still being quite smooth and a nice dinner beer. 
 
Overall this is pretty good, but there are a few off notes, traditional cervesa corny flavors and a bit of that corona like skunk, but a bit more rich and sweet than a lot of light Mexican beers. 
 
Taste is light and ""cervesa"" like with the skunky off note gone on the palate almost entirely until there is a faint note of it on the very end. The main flavor of this is corny crackery malts with a slight sweetness. This beer is not very bitter but would be quite good on a beach with canitas tacos and lime. 
 
Feel is bigger than a lot of other pale Mexican lagers. Decently long finish from the malt and somewhat full bodied while maintaining",3.03

Light amber to golden, a 1cm bubbly white head that disappeared completely after 20 seconds.

Grassy hops & a light bitterness, there was faint skunk & a few lager type malts & adjuncts. A bland & weak tasting beer that didn't taste great at all. 
 
Light bodied with a grainy feel to it, particularly towards the end of the beer & some chewy patches throughout. The body was very light & watery with some faint bitterness & slightly above average carbonation. 
 
A fairly poor beer from Beck's, although to be honest I wasn't really expecting much more for it in truth. The beer was far too weak & light which made it a drag to work my way down, it wasn't even good for a macro pale lager either & it's not one I'll be picking up again.",1.95

Becks's Vier,"On 28th Nov 13 I had a little Lager/Pilsner session and started off with a side by side Beck's v Beck's Vier. Both beers were poured into Veltin badged stemmed tulips. The Vier came in a green 275ml bottle, part of a pack. My son will get the rest of them. 
 
The Vier looked identical to the original Beck's in every way: golden, clear, bright and clean looking: the heads the same white un-lasting wisp, so many in this style of beer seem to have. 
 
This beer however was slightly sweeter and had less body depth than the stronger normal Becks, saccharine came to mind with the sweetness. 
 
Overall it was OK, grainy and a little too sweet for a good Lager, but nothing really bad (or good) about it.",2.7
Imperial Jack,"Somewhat British in nature, Rhinelander Brewing takes that uniquely sweet, hoppy and balanced taste and simply amps it up. 
 
Imperial Jack leaps right out with a lightly foggy honey amber for a slight orange appearance. A foamy and froathy cap gives a slight sandy hue that soon succumbs to its strength. 
 
Strong malt aromas portray bold elements of peppery hops and their citrusy, herbal, stone fruit and grassy perfumes with a balanced scent of toast, honey and nutiness. Flavors of sweetness soon follow with an earthy-sweet taste of caramel, barley, corn, buttered toast, sorghum and biscuit. 
 
A rise of British hop flavors reveal aspects of tree bark, earthen peat and light walnut provide a nealry tobacco-like sweetness to bridge the sweeter early palate with a more earthen mid-taste. Trending toward the bitterness of fresh cut grass and resiny pine, the balanced but not overly complex beer fares well but not nearly to the extend of the high IBU rates prescribed by the style. 
 
Full bodied to start, the beer's sweet weight persists into a worty finish with a candied hop balance. Finishing malty-sweet and residing slightly on the sweeter side of bitter-sweet, the beer may fare well in traditional England as a strong or stock ale, but today's Imperial IPA have drier, more bitter and more hop aromatic standards.",3.55

The nose is sweet and yeasty with some slight spoiled grain smell. Meh, the smell is boring. For flavor, this is not exceptional but very similar to Miller high life. Top end sweetness with faint yeast/white bread notes, quickly goes into some maltiness and hop bitterness in the middle. The finish is a little wet. I really enjoyed the body of this beer. Good sting carbonation that pricks your pallet with a fantastic creamy texture as it goes down. Very nice medium body. As you drink, the hops and ethyl acetate build up on your pallet, rendering your taste buds useless.

Has that classic Minhas brewery diacetyl butterscotch burnt bandaid aroma/taste. As it warms it begins to taste worse and worse, drink cold

Crazy Stallion,"This is a review of a 24 oz can. 
From the bottom of the can: ""CL01723 1752 FL"" 
 
Appearance: It has a nice warm gold colored body with excellent clarity. It is a beautiful looking beer. It starts out with a short white head but it doesn't last long at all. It quickly drops out to nothing. There is no lacing on the beer other than a few spots of bubbles that are so sparse you could count them individually. Aside from the lack of a sustained head or any lacing it is a gorgeous looking beer. 
 
Aroma: There is a very, very, very light hop aroma which smells a bit like noble hops. There is also a very light aroma of what smells like vinyl. It's not a very good smelling beer. 
 
Taste: There is a light noble hop character up front with a light hint of caramel. Towards the middle the flavor increases a bit and there is a touch of walnut with some more herbal notes. Although these flavors increase the overall flavor profile is still very mellow and the beer tastes watered down. There isn't any real flavor towards the back of the palate and the aftertaste is just this light walnut flavor. 
 
Mouthfeel: It tastes very light and watered down. It is very easy to drink. The can doesn't appear to list any ABV but it is important to note that there is no perceived alcohol in either the flavor or the mouthfeel of the beer, so it hides the ABV very well. 
 
Overall: This beer isn't going to win any prizes for being flavorful or aromatic, but it has a nice walnut aftertaste and it is very easy to drink. The label simply calls this a ""Classic LAGER"" and it is an easy drinking lager. It has a bit of a vinyl aroma but that was so subtle that it is only noticeable when you are trying to pick out an aroma from the beer; when drinking this normally it doesn't come through. 
 
Normally I wouldn't mention prices but this one has ""$1.50"" printed on the can itself. It's not a bad buy if you can get it for that price and just want a cheap and easy drinking lager. I would recommend it to those who are looking for a cheap beer that's easy to drink. I probably wouldn't buy this regularly but if I could get it for $1.50 I might buy a few to throw in a cooler with some hotdogs for a cheap camping meal.",2.84

I think I found a new chugged to hang at the BBQ in 95 degrees.,3.31
Crazy Stallion,"This isn't your normal type of beer, for 1.25 this is a friendly type of beer. Many may say "" oh it has a metallic taste"" but what were they drinking metal? Can't be compared to natty cause it doesn't taste water downed, can't be compared to let's say Heineken cause it's a bit malt liqour. This beer can hit the spot when you're in the dumps.

Crazy Stallion,"Was unexpectedly heading to the local commuter train and passed a bodega so I decided to grab a beverage to enjoy on my hour long trip. I spied this wonderful looking 24 oz. can in the cooler and was immediately inspired to take a closer look. Hand crafted, the ""label"" said (BTW what do you call the outside of a can? It isn't technically a label, but I digress). American made. Original even. And a Classic Lager. How could it get any better? Than, in the upper left corner of the aforementioned ""label"" was the coup de grace. $1.25! How could it be possible for such a highly touted product to be priced at such an inviting level? And for 1 PT, 8 FL OZ of anticipated golden nectar. It could only because prime example of American ingenuity at its finest. I had to have it and have it NOW! 
 
Caught my train by the skin of my teeth. Found a seat and prepared myself for the journey, both in the physical and the emotional. As the train departed the station, I cracked open the plebian tab that stood between me and the experience I so longed to have. 
 
How to rate this libation? How to describe it? The question of look remains unexplored. It is truly unfair to fault the beer for this so I fairly (I feel) out this required rating smack dab in the middle of the field. How could one even consider using and vessel but the magnificent aluminum that naturally covers it. Luckily the aroma is able to we escape through the approximately inch wide circle created by the escape valve commonly referred to as the tab. I can think of no other words to describe this than sickeningly sweet. This is not a value judgement, mind you, but a descriptive fact. A negative? Who am I to make such a judgement on an esteemed product like Crazy Stallion. 
 
But we know why you all are here. To discover the taste, the flavor, how does Crazy Stallion tickle the tongue. I can only confirm that I absolutely got my $1.25 (actually $1.50 once you calculate the government's share of the experience) of value. And what more can one truly ask for. Indeed, what more. This Crazy Stallion was possibly one of the finest travelling companions I have ever had on a commuter rail journey.",3.31
Crazy Stallion,"I picked up a 24oz tallboy at my local bodega for $1.25. I drank about half and poured the rest out. Has a awful sour metallic taste, like it’s been sitting in the can for years. I won’t buy it again.",1.25
Crazy Stallion,"$1.25 for a 24 oz beer can't beat that these days. I was pretty surprised how good this beer was. Tasted pretty good and if it's 5.9% abv then that is amazing. Doesn't really taste like its 5.9% seems about maybe 5% or somewhere between 4% to 5% abv but it says 5.9% on here so I guess that's what it is.  
 
I was thinking this was gonna be more crazy than it was you know since it says Crazy Stallion I was thinking it would be some pretty good stuff like Natty Daddy but was quite mild for the name crazy stallion. Should probably just be called grazing stallion or something like that.  
 
Taste reminds me of those cheap no brand beers they sell at some places that are about 4% to 5% abv. Taste reminds me of that cheap beer they sell at walgreens you get the 6 pack for like 3 or 4 dollars or something.  
 
The taste is pretty good for the price kind of a low carbonated flavor beer pretty decent. The main thing is the type of buzz you get really which seemed to be like a sleepy beer. Had to take a nap felt drowsy after drinking this. Not really a stimulating beer. But probably gonna definitely give it some more tries to see what its like some more. Maybe I may try this beer again but seems like that beer they sell at walgreens and has the same drowsy effect.

The beer pours the expected golden amber color with a white frothy head and light lacing. Head retention is fair at best. On the nose, I really don't get much of anything. Maybe some black pepper and some cereal grains, along with some faint sandalwood. Mouthfeel is more of the same in this very light and watery beer. The finish (what there is of it) is fairly dry with minimal bitterness. Alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile. I know it's only 5%, but I would have guessed it was even lower than that. So I guess this beer would be good for washing down salty or spicy food. It really is pretty watery stuff.

I'm not saying that this is a great beer, but for what it is, it actually came as a pretty positive surprise to me. Maybe it's because I'm having this rather fresh, but it's quite a crisp, refreshing lager that goes down easy in the sweltering heat.

Burleigh Bighead,"Bottle: has a child with an enormous head on it. Enough said. 
 
Appearance: considering this is a 'no-carb' beer, not too bad. That said, it looks a bit weak and flat, with a bubbling head that dissipates too quickly. 
 
Aroma: very little in the way of aroma. What vague whiff is apparent is standard grains. Quite dull. 
 
Taste: I don't really see the point of beers like this. Breweries have to understand that if a beer has almost no flavour, the only flavour that will come through is an awful, skunky off-metal grain. Mighty unimpressive. 
 
Aftertaste: disappears quickly, thank God. Still, that's half the problem - there isn't that much flavour to begin with. 
 
Mouth feel: thin and watery, with limited carbonation. Just keeps getting better... 
 
Overall: a pointless and hatefully awful beer from a brewer that ought to know better. With their range of fantastic beers, this is a truly awful deviation from the norm. Add to that the fact that it is the price of standard full-strength, it is actually quite insulting. If you want a beer, buy one. If you really want a decent boutique light, get a Rogers Beer. If you just want a reasonable light lager, go for your standard macro White Stag, XXXX Gold, Cascade Light, etc. I can assure you they are much, much better value, and taste a whole lot better.

Pours very clear and very light, with minimal body and a filmy, pure white head. Lacing is relatively persistent and leaves a pleasant frothy pattern down the inside of the glass. No, it's not a brilliant looking beer, but it's very decent for the style. 
 
Nose is crisp and adjuncty, with a note of corn or DMS, and a slightly sharper I-almost-want-to-call-it-hoppiness. But then it sinks back to sweet corn syrup and light vomitous astringency. No, not for me. 
 
Taste is almost devoid of character, even feeling—it's as though this beer disappears as soon as you put it in your mouth. Very thin and only leaving a hint of that corn because it has to. Really reminiscent of a wet tortilla. Appalling.

Cheap malt is the main flavour here, 6-row pale malt would be my guess. Sort of generic with vague caramel/malted milk ball notes and little else. Rather underwhelming...notches below Carlton Mid and similar competitors in terms of the Australian market.

XXXX Bitter,"A solid macro lager. L. Light gold with frothy, white head that fades quickly to lacing. Not much retention. S. Slight grain, but not much. T. Similar, light grain with a dry finish, a touch of astringency from the high carbonation. Can have a metallic tang, so I have always avoided drinking from cans. F. Light, a touch fizzy and the carbonation can have an astringent effect. O. I grew up on this stuff, it so dominated the Queensland beer market in the 1970s and 80s. So I have a soft spot for this beer and served cold it is an acceptable thirst quencher in the Queensland heat.",2.99

Labatt Ice,"L: Standard straw yellow lager color. Head looks okay but fades away quick. 
S: Hard to really smell much. Malt, a bit of alcohol, and the usual corn adjuncts. 
T: Possibly the most well rounded of the macro ""Ice"" beers. Corn, grassy hops, you can taste a bit of alcohol and the sweetness, but not offensive. You get a hint of the sour aftertaste like Milwaukees Best Ice, etc. but much less strong. It has a bit of that soy sauce taste you get in stronger beers, which I like. Not overwhelmed by corn sweetness or sour aftertaste. 
F: Less carbonated than some ice beers. Very refreshing and easy to drink. 
Overall: Definitely one of the best for the category. A very solid go-to for cheap beer enthusiasts.",3.45

The taste is semisweet corn plus stewed mixed vegetables and vegetable oil. Minimal bitterness and a hint of tart. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and somewhat dry finish.

Not sure why it is only getting a 65 but I liked it! It is smooth, drinkable, and has taste notes of adjuncts. The Maple leaf on the front fools Americans into buying a 30 pack for dirt cheap, calling it Canadian and even making a joke about the metric system, saying eh or cracks about geese, moose, and maple syrup.",3.36

Anyway, it is reasonably priced.  
 
The flavor is pretty standard for an ice beer. Better tasting than Milwaukee's Best Ice.  
 
I'm not really a fan of ice brewed beer, especially Keystone Ice, but this one is tolerable for what it's worth.

States on label - Beligian style and Quad Bock - Whatever that is supposed to mean:

The smell is of overripe fruitiness (tough to pick out any individual fruits - just a fruity character in general). Boozed-soaked caramel comes through loud and clear.Maybe a subtle hint of cotton candy? (Maybe that's the ""Belgian"" part?) 
 
The taste is something like sweet fruit punch with caramel. Raw alcohol is present in a malt liquor way. Harsh. 
 
This is a rough one. Doesn't really fit a style - maybe a doppelbock - but close to a malt liquor/Euro strong lager hybrid. It's cheap and high in abv.",2.2

Hell On High Quad Bock,"Pours with virtually no head, has an orangish amber color. Not the best smelling beer, has a malty smell with an odor that is best decribed as over ripened fruit, most people would not find this appealing.  
 
But when it comes to taste this seems to be ok for what it is, stronger beers like these are hard to find that are smooth or good tasting. Now this beer unfortunately is not an exception the taste is something along the line of over ripened apple, and there is definitely some alcohol burn with this one, not for everyone. Also very little carbonation. But definitely a bit better than most beers of this category. this is the type of beer you drink when you want to find your date more attractive.

Hell On High Quad Bock,"Rinkuškiai ""Hell On High Quad Bock"" 
16.9 fl. oz brown glass bottle, coded ""L.10443"" 
$2.99 @ Roger Wilco, Pennsauken, NJ 
 
Notes via stream of consciousness: Against my own better judgement having already had one of the strong beers from Rinkuškiai I'm going to go ahead and try ""Hell On High"". At least the label is good with a devilish looking character petting a white poodle. So, even with a rough pour I was unable to bring up a head. There's a little bubbly foam here and there but not much. That really hurts it in terms of appearance. The body is a very hazy deep amber with an orange sheen and golden highlights. The aroma is malty and caramelish with a light bit of apple-like fruitiness. The flavor follows and I'm quite surprised, it's much better than I thought it would be. The rich caramel maltiness is pleasant and not overdone, and there are no off-flavors. The alcohol does show slightly but I think it's actually helping to dry it in the finish along with its median bitterness, some herbal hops, and refreshing apple-like fruitiness. It could be a more carbonated but it's not bad, it works well with the full bodied maltiness. I'm going to guess it's around 2.0 volumes of CO2 where a standard beer is around 2.5 and a cask ale is more like 1.8. I keep smelling it, swirling it, waiting to find something bad come out as it warms but it hasn't happened yet. However, more and more alcohol is showing but we'll see if all of that malt keeps it in balance ... ... ... hmm, it's stayed pretty much the same except that it has lost some carbonation which leaves it even softer, and that hurts it on mouthfeel despite it's chewy maltiness. The bottle label did say it was bottle conditioned but I highly doubt that, and even if it was, it's hard to coax enough carbonation out at 14% ABV. So, what to say? It's perfect for malt heads, and those who just love strong beers. For anyone else it's more like a golden caramel flavored dessert beer, and even in that it's pretty one-sided. I'm surprised it's as clean as it is, and so not-hot with alcohol, but that's not enough to pull it beyond a decent beer despite it's ""quad bock"" status.",3.6
Hell On High Quad Bock,"We gotta call it for what it is. This is kind of an over-ABV joke label from Lithuania. 
a) Flat dark whiskey body, no head, nothing on top (fail). 
s) absolutely fine, with sweet fruit predominant, alcohol laden, fruit cake, cider, b&b.  
t) The taste follows nose but more complex, and nuanced with sweetness, whiskey soaked fruit, fruit cake, tempered by smokey malt and grain backbone, again whiskey like. A bit harsh after a few sips. (perhaps a good cooking liquid?)

Mouthfeel: heavy in body. Smooth from start to finish. Long lasting sweet and burning aftertaste. 
 
Overall: this beer is way too sweet with a rancid apple flavor with loads of alcohol burn. Not for me.",1.78
Hell On High Quad Bock,"This unique brew was enjoyed from the bottle in a snifter. Pouring a very nice 
clear and bright amber this beast produces a thin ring and subtle pool with very 
light lacing. Nose of heavy apple cider, light brown sugars, and strong grain alcohol. 
Flavors follow the nose with brown sugars and golden raisins awash in apple cider  
and beaten to death by strong warming grain booze. Decent mouth feel, warming and  
lightly coating. Let it warm and be lightly rewarded, yet know that the strength of the  
grains and booze increase as well beating you over the head with strong booze.  
 
Decent but a touch over the top without enough depth.

Cisk XS Extra Lager,"I found this single, 33Oml brown bottle at the Binny's store in Plainfield, IL for $1.99, so this is not a cheap beer as that price comes out to $12 a 6 pack. The freshness date on the back label says May 9th of 2O1O and this is already July of 2O1O, so I realize I am reviewing an out of date bottle. 
 
The beer poured a hazy yellowish/orange color and made a 1 finger fizzy white head that disappeared in under 3O seconds. There was very little lacing present. 
 
Sweet grainy smell mixed with alcohol, and call me crazy, but I'm also getting a trace of fruit - perhaps orange. 
 
This beer has an odd taste. Very sweet malt and grains steeped in alcohol. I can't get the alcohol off my tongue. I don't know if there are citrus hops in here, but there is some underlying orange flavoring to this as well, but overall it is NOT a tasty beer. It's an alcoholic mess. 
 
There's enough sugary sweetness in here to make it medium to full bodied, but even the relatively high carbonation cannot cut through the heavy amount of alcohol. Alcohol coats the tongue and leaves a nasty sweet alcoholic aftertaste. 
 
Not a very drinkable beer, but it will at least give you a buzz with just one.",1.87
Cisk XS Extra Lager,"This is an interesting brew, from Malta, a small Island off of Italy that used to be controlled by the British. This is there version of a strong lager, and this is a good example how the Euro Strong lager and British influence combine to make a interesting brew. 
 
This is a pale yellow, and crystal body. The smell is sweet, with a nice hop bitterness. 
 
The taste is crisp, almost like a good Euro Lager with more abv. 
 
Not the best beer ever, but decent. I really don't know why it got so many bad reviews. This is a pretty good beer, much better than a D or F.",3.07
Cisk XS Extra Lager,"A brew from the fine Mediterranean island country of Malta, eh? 12 oz bottle with a best before stamp of Feb 10. Pours a clear, medium gold color with a pretty nice cap of white foam that lasts pretty long for a Euro Lager. Leaves some decent lacing as well. 
 
Smell is nose-wrinklingly bad. Smells like a homeless skunk living under the overpass that just drank a fifth of cheap vodka and shat all over himself. Okay, maybe not quite that bad, but I do ask myself: Dare I take a sip? Smells so damn boozy with corn-syrup cloying sweetness. 
 
Whew...those poor, poor Maltanian bastards! This stuff is wicked bad. Imagine a 40 oz of malt liquor boiled down to about 12 oz, becoming the consistency of thin syrup and adding 3 ounces of grain alcohol...that is pretty much what this tastes like. Sweetness is ridiculously cloying and the beer is viscous as hell feeling in the mouth. Avoid at all costs unless you are a glutton for punishment. Am I going to finish this bitch? Maybe, but only because I had to buy two of these MFers cause the first one exploded in my freezer.",1.44
Cisk XS Extra Lager,"Pours out a nice yellowy-orange color with a bit of head, deceiving me into thinking this could be a good find. 
 
However, upon smelling, all I get is a grainy alcohol smell with perhaps a bit of sweetness. I think, ""this beer is 9% abv, so I guess I can accept that"", but have a feeling this could be a bad omen. 
 
The taste is really not enjoyable. I've had plenty of stronger beers, but none of them tasted like alcohol as much as this. Really overpowers any of the light sweetness in the flavor. 
 
Again, the alcohol dominance didn't really help the mouthfeel.  
 
I would not drink another one unless someone paid me to. I'm not really familiar with the Euro Strong Lager style so I'm not sure if it's an acquired taste, but I don't think I'll be acquiring it any time soon.",1.69
Cisk XS Extra Lager,"Bright goldenrod (almost orange) with a few tiny flakes being buffeted about by a few tiny bubble streams. Either the beer isn't filtered or the filter didn't have very small pores. The cream colored crown looks pretty good. It's richly creamy and is doing a bang-up job with lace, especially considering the ABV and the probable lack of hops. 
 
The nose is similar to the nose on every other Euro strong lager on the face of the earth. It features vodka-soaked grain with a side order of noble hops. A very small side order. Maybe it's the American in me, but malt liquor smells and tastes better than most ESLs. 
 
I've had worse. Less jet fuel flavor and more... uh... anything else would have been an improvement. This is far from refined beer, but then I knew that going in. It has an odd sort of charm if you like high-octane lagers that numb the tongue. I can't imagine that applies to many beer drinkers... who don't live on skid row. 
 
If you've had any of the Euro strong lagers from Eastern Europe, then you already know what Cisk Extra Lager tastes like. Think pale malt and grass steeped in grain alcohol, then cut with mineral water. Moderate sweetness and moderate bitterness keep things moderately uninteresting to the end. 
 
The mouthfeel isn't horrible if you like them on the full and quiet side. A lingering slickness is kept from being stickiness by the solvent quality of the ethanol. No one drinks this stuff for the mouthfeel anyway. They drink it for the brainfeel. 
 
Cisk XS is my second Maltese beer and is my second lousy Maltese beer. On the positive side, after two or three bottles, the rest should go down pretty easily. If you decide to take the plunge and buy a bottle (not recommended), don't forget the brown paper bag.",2.14
Cisk XS Extra Lager,"Nose is grainy with very soft noble hops. Smells okay. 
 
Pours a medium yellow, good clarity, mild creamy head with lasting retention. Looks pretty good.s 
 
Creamy malty, sweet, tart, and a little bitter. Soft, sweet malt makes a great flavor for the smooth, creamy body that lends itself to nice carbonation. Grainy and toasty with biscuit and nut tones; warm and inviting. Somewhat tart/sour noble hops add a little grounding and then almost disappear. There's a little hop flavor - clean, flowery, and earthy/herbal. Finishes fairly clean, slight nutty malt, just slight. Tastes good. Feels very good. Good drinkability.

Cisk XS Extra Lager,"Pours into a pint glass with a hazy deep yellow color. Thin white head disapates quickly leaving more scum than lace behind. 
 
Aroma is sweet and grainy like canned corn. 
 
Flavor is also on the sweet side. Like many a macro it's mostly corn or rice from what I can tell. It has an awful grain alcohol heat to it almost like a shot of cheap vodka was added.

Cisk XS Extra Lager,"Poured into an American pint glass, this beer is a very pale, quite clear straw-gold color, with a substantial 2-finger head on top. The nose is quite grainy, with a little hint of solvent. Ugh, an extremely sweet, nearly cloyingly sweet beer, with no hint of anything hoppy, together with medicinal, very harsh alcohol. Thin-bodied and watery, and nearly undrinkable. I couldn't finish a single glass--I'll have to find someone to give this away to.",1.59
Cisk XS Extra Lager,"Appearance: It's very clear and a lighter gold color. It has a foamy white head that maybe reaches a finger deep. It receded pretty quickly and left an average lacing behind. Very average.  
 
Smell: It's very sweet smelling up front. There's some earthy/grainy notes. Smells a tad vegetal. I'm definitely picking up a slight big of corn. Alcohol comes through very strong. At 9%, I expected that to some degree. But, it's more prevalent than it should be.  
 
Taste: Mother of God. Someone needs to head down to Malta and teach those doods how to brew some beer. Wow. This is one sweet and sugary brew. There's some light fruity notes (pear and apple mostly). Light caramel/toffee flavors add more sweetness. It is grainy and earthy. There's a light vegetal, corn-like flavor. Alcohol is very prevalent and downright hot. It's offensive. Finishes very hot.  
 
Mouthfee/Drinkability: It's close to being thick. Carbonation feels pretty light. It's not smooth, but it's not bad. This is probably its strength (if you want to call it that). Drinkability is poor. The flavor is not good and it's way too hot. There's nothing to really enjoy here. 
 
I picked up this beer a few days ago out of curiosity. I was told it was bad. It's actually worse than I expected. I can't pick out a flaw here or there to pick on. It needs so much work all across the board. I wouldn't recommend it. Well, maybe if you're looking for a beer from Malta. But, there's got to be a better one than this, right?",1.98
Cisk XS Extra Lager,"A: Much like the original lager, poured a crystal clear, golden-orange with a frothy, paper white head that was 2 fingers high and displayed a very good retention rate. Visible carbonation was light, while the lacing left a thin, film sheeting behind.  
 
S: The nose yielded fresh corn on the cob, fresh grains, with some dried hay and sweet corn fructose. Overall found this to be rather uneventful when compared to their cisk lager which was more aromatic and hoppier. This was average at best with some corn liquor detection. 
 
T: The flavor was overly sweet with some sweet corn, green corn stalks and a medicinal taste that was hard to describe, reminded me of walking down a sterile hospital hall. Some sour bittering with fermented fruit which tasted more like some prison hooch. Overall no real flavor just corn meal and alcohol.  
 
M: slick, very oily and was light bodied leaving a sour corny finish.  
 
D: Drinkability was not good as to be expected. Didn't really care to finish this one and was a struggle to justify why. A huge disappointment when compared to its original lager which was more hoppy, grainy, and flavorful, this one came off as cheap corn/malt liquor and comes with a non recommend and a cheers to their original lager.",1.91
Cisk XS Extra Lager,"A - Pours crystal clear and light gold. Head is pure white and tops out at around half inch. Retention is average. A fairly healthy amount of lace clings to the sides of the glass. Not a bad looking brew. Looks refreshing overall. 
 
S - Sweeter malt aromas are first to radiate from this one. Some honey here, some pale malt there. Not cloying but I can already tell this beer could be very sweet. Alot of graininess pushes through about midway. Hot alcohol finishes things off.  
 
T - Sweet and hot. Pale malt, honey, sugar, and more pale malt kind of get shoved on to the palate by a burning alcohol flavor. Just a hint of apple combines with the sweetness but that is just not even close to enough to bring balance. Big grainy flavors are present but still can't balance the flavor too well.  
 
M - On the fuller side of medium bodied with light carbonation that seems to work well with the brew. Finish is hot and sweet while staying clean.  
 
D - Drinkability is really not looking good for this brew. Too sweet and too hot. It would be best to just start all over with this brew. Take it back to the drawing board and start tweaking until something a little better wass produced. Not recommended at all.",2.24
Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,,2.74
Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,"Red Horse Extra Strong is crystal clear and pale amber in color. Thin streams of carbonation support a cloudy bone white head with fairly average retention. 
Taking a sniff, the first thing I smell is generic, almost sugary sweetness. Soda cracker comes in second, lending support to the up front aromas of sugar. Aromas of malt and sugar lead into a center where I smell corn adjuncts and the lagery whiff of sulfur. Mix in the alcoholic burn of this beer's 8% abv and the aroma takes on a vaguely white wine quality. The finish is full of the leafy, fresh cut grass smell of European hops. 
On the tongue, flavors of corn adjunct and alcoholic spiciness dominate up front. Those flavors lead right into flavors of sulfur. Those flavors combine in a way that isn't very flattering or enticing. Flavors of soda cracker or baked bread are nonexistent. Sugary sweetness provides an interesting through note, adding just enough to the proceedings to give an unflattering illusion of white wine. Bitter is crisp and bitter. 
It's just not that good a beer. It's almost as though the brewery took every thing people hate about lager and distilled them together into one product. Red Horse Extra Strong's only real redeeming feature is that it's inexpensive and it's strong. Beyond, I'd give this beer a hard pass.",2.54

Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,Bought this at the local Filipino market in a pint can four pack. Pours a large foamy head but then dissipates quickly - clear golden color.

I would compare this to Steel Reserve - but the taste is lighter and a bit more bitter yet sweet at the same time. Not a bad beer and worth a try if you're curious.,3.13

I know it's nothing to praise but still, as many legends grew around this type of beer I just had to drink it. 
Looks a bit darker and intense than a pale lager but somehow you can tell that it's perhaps the coloring. The smell is also not that powerful and the taste also lacks the impression that makes a great beer - but it feels good to drink!

I, like many others I am sure, thought it would be at least a decent buy because of brewery location but I was so wrong. Waste of my money and time. I would almost rather be drinking a macrobrew.

Very light yellow colored liquid. Like honey water (not in a good way). Only slightly more yellow color than your average BMC product. Good two-finger white foamy head that leaves a thin film on top with no lacing. 
Not very appealing looking, actually. 
 
Sweet sugarey band-aids mixed with artificial fruit flavoring dominate the nose. Smells similar to RedBull, really. Very slight malt scent is detected. 
 
Oh my god, it's foul. Imagine if you gave someone a tumbler of tequila and RedBull (why?), on ice, then put out two or three cigarettes in it and let it sit on the counter until the next morning. Upon waking, your hungover self blindly grabs that glass and takes a drink. This beer tastes like that. 
 
Thick and putrid. Honestly, it's that bad. 
 
Stay away! Don't do it! Save Yourself! 
I picked this beer up because of it's origin, geographically, which is Malta. Never heard anything about their beer making skills. Now I know why.

Aroma: there is a touch of cereal grain there, but much more adjuncts - particularly rice. Smells cheap if not offensive. 
 
Taste: I don't mind some Asian adjunct beers - some actually make the rice taste quite nice. This is not one of those beers. An awkward fug from the rice, and only cheap and light cereals to back it up. 
 
Aftertaste: more rice awkwardness on the finish. Not a great beer. 
 
Mouth feel: light in body to the point of being somewhat watery, with a moderate to higher carbonation.

On the pour one finger of white head formed with clouds of carbonation. After the pour carbonation calms, and head starts receding to a thin cap. Standard golden straw yellow. 
 
Aroma is a touch corny with an almost lemony yeast aroma, that stops just shy of the cheap beer aroma that you can get a lot of the time. Comes off as super bright and dry. 
 
Taste is actually pretty good, especially for a macro lager. Quite different than most macro USA lagers, with a much brighter flavor up front that reminds me slightly of Kona Blond Ale. The finish has a light adjunct corn and malt flavor, but it is very clean. Also very light. 
 
Feel is light chuggable bright and refreshing. Still a full flavor brew, and short of being a light lager. Quick finish in flavor but mouthfeel lingers a bit longer.

Tastes watered down, generally. As this is brewed by Sleeman's, it carries the same profile - not too varied, and drinkable.

Maclay's Traditional Pale Ale,"Wanted to do a formal review of this one so revisiting. 473 ml can served cold into a pint glass. Purchased for $2 CDN. 
 
Appearance - weak pale golden straw color. Decent finger of head was poured but doesn't last long. Some visible bubbles and the tiniest string of lacing left behind. Looks like a macro. 
 
Smell- some grainy notes and a bit of a cooked vegetable wrapped around metal vibe as well. Smells like a macro.

Mouthfeel - it's wet and has a little less than average carbonation. Feels like a macro. 
 
Overall - there's not too much good to say about this other than that it rates on par with macros, and as far as English pale ales go, it's pretty bad.

Head is immediately fizzy and not fine. Retention isnt great but it settles ad a surprisingly thick cap and ring. Body is a solid but light yellow straw with fine but plentiful carbonation. Lacing does form nicely, but isn't throughout the whole glass. 
 
Aroma is Metallic with enough acetaldehyde to throw wine aromas. Fruity and dry, but for a lager that isn't great. Not skunky, but VERY yeasty. 
 
Taste is incredibly light for what it is, similar to budweiser, ricey, but surprisingly clean considering the aroma. The acetaldehyde is still present, and a bready malt is not present at all. 
 
Feel is dry and maintains drinkability even as it warms. Long finish but incredibly dry and attenuated.

On the pour a light 2 finger fine head forms, then over the course of a couple minutes it dissipates to a ring around the glass. The body is a light golden straw with relatively lazy carbonation for the style. No lacing.  
 
Aroma is quite malty with some nice crackery notes, and the yeast is also quite detectable but in a slightly estery generically beery sort of way. Everything smells very light. There is a slight hint of grassy herbal hops. For the style this isn't half bad. As the beer warms diacetyl does become noticable. 
 
Flavor is quite similar to the aroma but with some detectable adjunct sweetness. Hop bitterness is present but vague and the malt is quite sweet. Again once the beer warms diacetyl is present, keep this one cold and probably don't pour it into a pils glass.  
 
Feel is crisp with a high carbonation bite and a nice foamy head to make the beer feel softer. This is a very cheap beer and for the price it could be a whole lot worse, it's pretty dang drinkable.  
 
Overall this is a cheap full flavor lager that isn't terrible with a nice malty character. There is some off but as long as it stays cold it's a pretty good budget option.",2.87

Genesee Beer,"Being from northeastern Ohio this has been a staple of my beer consuming years. Genesee is not a complex lager and is an easy drinking beer. There are no off setting flavors to speak of and its simplicity makes it very drinkable. Barley malt, yes, corn grits because that's what American and Canadian brewers use to brew for the masses and then finally  
hops. Genesee ""red eye"" doesn't have the off putting vegetable oil flavor of MHL or the wet carboard flavor of A.B. You can drink 1 or 6, the flavor is consistent and if your in the mood for a boiler maker this is the perfect choice hands down.",3.36
Yanjing 11º Premium,,2.5
Yanjing 11º Premium,"Coming in a 330ml can, BB 24/04/2012, served chilled in a stemmed lager glass. 
 
A: coming in a dark straw colour with moderate carbonation, without a substantial beer head.  
S: light maltiness with a doughy edge, not assertive but the slightly sour note of lager beer is obvious, at times reminiscent of prunes even. 
T: a gassy swallow of semi-sweet grainy malts precedes the lightly dry palate and a mysterious sour edge, while an interesting perfumey touch of fruitiness lingers at the back as well. It’s not particularly dry in the finish, but pretty clean without bad influence from sickly sweetness, either. 
M&D: the carbonation feels more lively on the tongue than meets the eye, the body is thin but not totally without form. All in all, this lager beer is a watered-down version of German Helles lager with added adjunct. Not horrible as Bud or Coors, though.",2.53
Yanjing 11º Premium,"Big 600ml bottle from some hole on the alley in Hong Kong. Around a buck forty. Served in a tiny glass. 
Pours a thin yellow color, with a nice head that disappears in about 3 seconds... like a soda. Quick swirl produces nothing to smell, so I pour again and smell fast. 
Smells a bit like urine and corn... getting better. Lol. 
Taste is a bit of ginger, and generic lager flavor... but the ginger is at least semi interesting.  
Thin, and not surprising, not that great. But the ginger was a surprise.",1.75
Yanjing 11º Premium,"Appearance: Light golden color. Less than a finger of foam on pouring, lasted less than 3 seconds, leaving nothing with which to lace. 
 
Smell: Very sweet malty smell. Sugary, cotton candy. 
 
Taste: Okd musty taste. Wonder where all that sweetness went? Not here. A touch of bitterness. 
 
Mouthfeel: Light body. Crisp finish. Plenty of carbonation to scrub the palate. 
 
Overall: Getting close to drain-pour territory. The taste is not appealing to me. As with all my reviews, glad I tried it, if only to know not to buy it again.",1.97

The beer pours mostly bright light amber with off white head. The head recedes to a thin cap, but leaves no lacing. The aroma is moderate in strength featuring stale, dusty grain and vegetable oil. The taste is semisweet slick malt with sucrose sweetness, orchard fruit and a hint of floral hop. Minimal bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a fairly undry finish. Overall, average malt liquor, but not super enjoyable...",3.28

Old Monk 10000,"Sampling a cold 650 ml bottle of this beer poured into a chalice, because why not? 
Consuming as part of the online malt liquor tasting. 
The beer pours a bright rich clear golden color with a fizzy bleached white head foaming up about 1 cm. This foam fades to a thin edge layer and one large island in the center of my glass. Several lazy streams of carbonation rise to the surface. 
The aroma is fairly mild on this one with a little bit of grain and some general sweetness, with a bit of apple cider note and some corn husk. But very faint all around, may open up as it warms? 
First sip reveals a light to medium body with fine and spacious carbonation. Texture is a little thin yet slick and does leave a slight coating feel on my lips. 
Flavor is briefly grainy malt and then apple juice, apple cider and refined sugar. The finish is a little bit of white wine or green grape and tarter cider note. no hops no booze. Very easy to drink minus the sweetness and proximal to apple cider character. Finish is lingering now with that white wine note.

T: Certainly an abbey ale. Full cracker and bready malts. Starts easy to drink, but gets a bit forward, sweet, and medicinal: an over the top middle taste that is hard to swallow.

T: oh yeah, but then no... dry, vaguely corn-meal cereal overtone, soft blast of ethanol through the middle, sort of stale, floury finish, lingering a sec before quietly degrading in the aftertaste... after a few moments, a vague (dry) apple pie flavor flickering... like a cider/champagne/malt liquor cocktail; flavors have a bit more pop/focus outta the teku 
 
F: quiet heat lingering back and top of palate, rounded mellow bite... bottom of palate feels relatively dry and clean... marginally ragged around the edges, but doesn't have much viscosity or burn

Boxer Ice,"I recently consumed a king can of boxer ice on my birthday. From the first sip I knew their was something wrong. Despite the hiss of the can as I opened it, their was a lack of carbonation. It had the sweet taste of malted corn syrup and the aftertaste of the can it was in. I question how something like this got past quality control as this is probably the most foul cheaply thrown together beers out there.

Smell - Very light grains wafting in from a distant wind. 
 
Taste - Cream soda? It's weird. Mostly nothing, but a slight vanilla flavor.

Boxer Ice,"Served straight out of the freezer into a room temp Weizen glass..  
 
Pours an apricot golden blonde color, 20% opaque. Tall 4 finger head; eventually it eats away to 1 finger and then finally a creamy ring.  
 
Aroma is wet cardboard, herbs, apple cores, banana peel, corn kernels. It actually smells pretty fresh and clean with character.  
 
A deep malt and straw base starts it off, but quickly fades to corn juice...then cotton candy. To draw a picture - think of a buttered cob of corn dipped in powdered sugar. Some tin follows.  
 
It's rather thick and juicy for an ice beer, but still somewhat crushable. Medium bodied (dare I say), and a carbonated finish.

If you've never had 10-year old, basic-strength pale lager before, you're in luck!... poured this into my HR Tubinger mug... darn near crystal clear medium-amber-colored liquid; good bit of foam on the pour, but it collapses shortly after construct... slightly grainy, corny lead aroma with moderately heavy apple/cider overtone; overall only mildly off-putting from oxidation I suppose... much of the scents carry over into the flavors; notable dry vacuum mid-palate, devoid of depth; again, not terrible, given its age... fairly dry and quick on the palate, with a slight residual slickness, but little fizz to break it up... surprised this wasn't a total disaster, but I lasted about 7-8 sips before moving on; more of this might've went down had it been near freezing and/or it was in the 90s (2072)",2.67

Color is a clear yellow with lots of huge bubble trails. Aroma is the best thing with the beer, is sweet, beerish, hint of hop and malt. Flavor is sweet, hint of malt & hop bitter and lots of carbonic tang. Body is ok, but the carbonation is so harsh that it totally dominates, Finish is a little strange - it's like flavor and is fairly short while leaving a neutral sweetness and alcohol warmth. Maybe the warmth is there due to the heavy carbonation enhancing the 5% into feeling stronger. Not very good stuff.",1.62

Deep gold color. Definitely more visual appeal than most, and it left lace rings on my glass, too.  
The nose is pretty pedestrian. A bit on the sweet side. 
Tastes a hair sweet, but not overbearing. The hops leave a bit of an herbal note. A little bit of a cereal grain character doesn't impart any major problems. This isn't too bad, really. 
I had no problem downing the bomber of this at my local Indian restaurant, and I might even be tempted to order it again the next time I'm there.

But for if you only have $15, and want drinkable quantity, at the lowest possible price, this is your best bet.  
 
Much better than the regular Boxer. Just a surprisingly non-sh**y beer - for being a sh** beer that is.",2.71

Royal Challenge Indian Premium Lager,"Pours amber with a tiny head. 
Nose shows sweet light malt, vegetables, light floral notes and brown sugar. 
Very sweet tasting, more cooked vegetables and cardboard. Practically no bitterness. Somewhat cloying. 
Carbonation is much too high, body watery.",2.22
Royal Challenge Indian Premium Lager,"This is one brew ive never heard of and after tasting i hope i never do again it pours a see through straw hue with average carbonation that leaves behind a one finger head that quickly dissaptes and leaves no lacing,the smell is pretty horrible with hints of grains and weak grassy hops,it has a light bodied well carbonated macro mouthfeel and the only tastes i get are grains,pale malts and weak grassy hops and overall to be honest this brew is definately one to avoid and hate to say it but no matter how good the indian food just go kingfisher instead.",1.3
Royal Challenge Indian Premium Lager,"Served in a pokal glass from the 650ml bottle 
 
When you go to an Indian restaurant the beer you should get an Indian beer. That was the thought process that led me on Valentine's day to getting this beer while getting my girlfriends favorite type of food. Well as it turns out all of the Indian beers on the menu were AAL, though I had never heard of most of them it was like throwing darts at a dart board trying to figure out which one to choose. How can you turn down a beer called Royal Challenge? 
 
This beer pours a golden straw color faint white foam that didn't last very long. The smell was sweet with aromas that included sweet corn and malted sugar. The flavor when it was initially poured into a frosted glass from a cold bottle, was a pleasant yet corn filled sweetness. The unfortunate part is that I had to take down all 650ml by myself. That meant that that the beer was sure to warm up. When it was cold it was almost pleasantly sweet to drink, as it warmed it became like drinking a watery corn syrup that was no longer pleasant to consume. The mouthfeel was rather sticky the whole time, which for a light beer wasn't as desirable as you might imagine. This beer was only temporarily drinkable then it became pretty awful to drink. It wasn't the worst Indian beer I got to consume, but there is still a long way for this country to go before it starts producing good beer.",2.85

Shiner Märzen-Style Oktoberfest,"Crystal clear, color looks alright, but I have difficulty with this sort of color (color blind). Head is anemic, dissipating quickly, and leaving no cap. 
 
Aroma is initially fruity lager esters (i.e., ""generic beer"" aroma). Toasty, bread crusty, and caramel. The caramel starts to take over on subsequent nosing, trending toward toffee, though the crustiness is still present. Mild herbal hop character is apparent in the background as well. Not particularly deep or complex, but not unpleasant, though caramel and esters are not appropriate for the style. 
 
On the palate, the arrival is sweet malt, with fruity esters running through out. The mid palate comes strongly into a pleasant bread crust flavor, followed by good hop bitterness. The finish is dry and pleasant, with a lingering mild bitterness. The caramel and toffee are in the palate as well, but the crusty flavor is stronger. Again, not really appropriate for the style. 
 
Mouthfeel is a bit on the light side, close, but not quite creamy. Moderately carbonated, and a pleasantly dry finish.

Very slight herbal edge to the aroma, but not nearly so dank as Amarillo and Mosaic can trend. Juicy notes are a decent balance of tropical and citrus fruit, with perhaps a slight edge to the latter. 
 
Flavor follows, as it's a creamy, juicy, fruity IIPA that carries a slight herbal edge to round out the profile. Tasting notes of melon, pineapple, papaya, mandarin orange, nectarine, lemon, lime. While the nose is fairly balanced between the main fruity notes, the palate certainly leans more tropical.

It delivers an intense burst of citrus and other fruit, wrapped in a creamy mouthfeel, but i do think it could use a touch more bitterness at the end - there's less than I remember in the lower ABV variants. Interestingly, the aftertaste has quite a bit of bitter orange peel, so the bitterness is there - it's just masked by the fruit.

All Hallows Treat,"For those who think that you have to give up the childhood treats for craft beer, Brewery Ommegang has some news for you! Applying a light coat of chocolate and peanut butter onto a Belgian-styled stout gives us a little more treat and a much less trick. 
 
Dark and rusty garnet, All Hallows Treat comes with a yeasty fogginess and a heady tarnish froth. As the scent of fruit and chocolate come first, the undercurrents of peanut, vinous spice and deep caramelization provides a complex and balanced aroma. Sweet with brown sugar, hard candy and chocolate, the early palate shares a malty balance with a sugary coat of spice cake. 
 
As the ale rolls along the middle palate, the fruit flavors of cherry, date, fig and raisin links up with a near pie-spice medley of cinnamon, allspice, clove and ginger for that quintessential Beglain balance. But then the chocolate and peanut come together in a buttercup way especially with the lingering candied sweetness that leads to a vinous, peppery and woodsy taste late on the palate. 
 
Full bodied and malty-dry overall, the beer carries a drying and relaxed sense of maltiness with hints of cola and coffee into a long aftertaste redolent with red wine and spiced rum.",3.84

I must reiterate this is not a sweet beer, though it's got all the desserty flavors just begging for decadent dulce... not so much bitter as it is more tart, stamping a stingy stripe across the middle of the tongue... brief bit of bouncy roundness to its body before it drops mad dry at the palate floor, airy aft, but leaving a woody-tannic warmth pasting the palate roof... this tastes and drinks beautifully, though looks a little suspect and has that superb cherry accent to it that doesn't feel quite right, but ultimately arguably for sure (mostly) tastes like a Flemish brown; this is a work of art, wish I knew and bought more (2198)",4.41

Juicy Bits,"In my 45 years I've called six different U.S. cities home. None of those six have been Greeley, Colorado. And frankly, it's not a likely candidate to become number seven. However, that's not because I don't appreciate it. I currently live nearby and for all the S**t it catches, it beats a lot of other places. The artistic talent, the agriculture, the community...the beer. It's all underappreciated and underrated. So with that in mind, I review a beer I never wanted to like, but nonetheless fell in love with and have in my refrigerator almost all the time.  
 
APPEARANCE: These days, this beer pours about the same orange color as the can it comes in. Well, maybe more like the slightly more yellow-ish orange band around the bottom of the can. That's the perfect fit. It's pretty opaque, even for a Hazy IPA. A fresh printer-paper white head rises slightly above the surface with a heterogeneous mix of bubble sizes. It's not a tall head, but it holds its ground. Despite the opacity, there is still a sense of liveliness in the bubbles rushing up the sides of the glass. 
 
SMELL: I get orange peel, vanilla, and lactose in equal parts on the first sniff...pretty much every time. Underneath there's a piney character with a touch or fresh cut grass. The latter of which compels that first, refreshing sip.  
 
TASTE: Orange from the nose is still present, but now it's in 3rd or 4th place. If I didn't know better I would think that Yuzu was added to this brew (tastes like Lemon + Honey), but even if it's just the hops those two flavors ring strong. An pleasant Earthiness provides the base/backbone to the palate. A nice, bitter finish begs for the next sip. 
 
MOUTHFEEL: It seems sweet...at first. But it isn't. It may be bittersweet, but it's dryer than it feels like it should be. That sweetness, as mentioned above, gives way to that dry, bitter finish. The body is somewhere between light-to-medium and medium-heavy. It's oddly hard to tell and sort of depends on your mood. I don't think I've ever written anything like this in any of my previous 500+ reviews. It's a unique feel. 
 
OVERALL: I refused to drink this beer for over a year after it came out. The hype train was too much for me. I did not want to like it. Deep down I knew I would. A friend basically forced me to try it one night and the first sip was pure gold. Is it life changing? No. Is it perfect Hazy IPA? No. That status is reserved for beers named Le Jus. We'll get to that another time. So what is this? It's a legendary example of a relatively new style of beer and one of Colorado's finest examples of creativity, experimentation, and mostly, high quality execution. Nice job, Weldwerks. You're legendary.",4.43

The beer has a three finger tall dense creamy sudsy foamy off-white head that slowly reduces to a couple of medium sized patches of medium thick film covering approximately 15% of the surface of the beer each surrounded by a large patch of slightly mottled very thin film covering the remainder of the surface of the beer and a medium thick ring at the edges of the glass. Slightly heavier than moderate amounts of lacing are observed. 
 
S: Moderate to strong aromas of juicy citrus/orange + citrus/orange zest + tropical/passionfruit + gooseberry hops over the top of light to moderate aromas of biscuit + oat + wheat malts with a light to moderate amount of sugary sweetness. 
 
T: Upfront there are light to moderate flavors of biscuit + oat + wheat malts with a light to moderate amount of sugary sweetness. That is followed by moderate to strong flavors of juicy citrus/orange + citrus/orange zest + tropical/passionfruit + gooseberry hops which contribute a minimal amount of bitterness which fades away quickly leaving moderate lingering citrus zest + passionfruit hop flavors. 
 
M: Medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Moderate amounts of creamy soft/fluffiness mid-body and a light amount of dryness in the finish. 
 
O: Easy to drink with well hidden alcohol and a pleasantly refreshing creamy soft/fluffy mouthfeel. Enjoyable with lots of citrus + passionfruit + gooseberry hop flavors/aromas.",4.3

Octoberfest Beer,Not overly sweet or malty. Lighter in body (and taste) than others in this style. I prefer this to the overly heavy US offerings.,3.69

Octoberfest Beer,"My favorite Octoberfest beer for 2022. Bells continues to produce some very good beers at volume quantities. Very smooth, very drinkable, and very tasty.",4.34
Octoberfest Beer,"1.5 x 12 ox ml bottle 
Bottle Date 07.15.2022 
Glassware: 0.5 L Festmug 
Temp at Pour: 52.8 F 
ABV: 5.5 % 
IBUs: 24 
 
 
Look: 
The color is clear medium copper with what seems to be gold highlights. The head starts as 2+ fingers of frothy and fizzy off-white foam that quickly dissolves to ring-and-islands. Decent lacing in on the glass. 
 
Smell: 
Lightly toasted grains and bread and lots of them. There is also a dry crackery note. Faint notes of fresh-cut grass flirt in the background as does an equally faint spiciness. 
 
Taste: 
A quick hit of sweet caramel comes at the start but is quickly submerged (for the most part) in toasted malts and grains. An earthy spiciness and moderate bitterness then arrive and the sip begins to dry out. The sip finishes lightly dry, somewhat spicy and moderately bitter. 
 
Feel: 
Crisp with a slightly astringent finish. The body feels between medium and medium-light. 
 
Overall: 
A shade or two (or three) too bitter for your typical Märzen (especially a German one) but quite drinkable nonetheless. It is not too sweet or caramelly nor overly bitter. So it is a decent to solid American Okto. Which for me is equivalent to saying a nice mid-to-late fall/autumn amber lager. 
 
My ratings are primarily for this beer as a Märzen. I would score it higher as an amber lager.",3.48

Thumbprint Enigma,"Thanks to FBarber for this one, from a ninja box during NBS BIF #12. 12oz bottle (no date) poured into 6oz NG flute (also courtesy FBarber). Poured a dark brown color, with some reddish hints at the translucent edges. There was 1/4 inch of tan head that dissipated quickly and left no lacing. 
 
The aroma had nice malts, good wood scents, some cherry, and a touch of yeast spice/funk. 
 
Pretty similar on the tongue, with the funk taking the lead. The fruit was noticeable but not dominant, and the wood added a nice counterpoint.

That is all to say this was the only Japanese lager available at my local packie. Pours a pale golden. It's light and provides a good compliment to the heaviness of the fried chicken.

Pours light-gold with clarity and 2-finger near-white head, with decent retention, leaving some sketchy Belgian lace down the glass. Lots of sweet, mild malt and some mild hop spice aromas off pour, with the latter gone so quickly I may have imagined it, and the sweet malt aroma continuing but fading into a little earthy funk and, as warms, a hint of tart stone fruit and that coy hop spice. On tasting, begins sweet, mild malt, which continues until interrupted by a hint of earthy funk, before a very drying, slightly noble hop bitter and spicy, disappearing rather than crisp finish.

First sip is a delicious melange of green apple and pears, nearly a cider, in terms of flavor.

The light clean taste would cut through and complement some of the fatty full flavor of pork.  
I’ll tell you something else, at 4.2 abv I think this would make a decent session beer. It’s a clean enough taste that I can see have four or five of these without it becoming cloying. It’s not overly sweet like some beers and ciders.

Berliner Apfel,"(12 oz bottle, no date/code; purchased single off shelf at their Beer Depot this week... poured into a shaker pint) 
 
mildly-cloudy, yellow straw colored liquid; ultra-tight, cottony foam that builds high and lasts long... on the nose: apple cider, mushed up fresh apple; nothing suggesting great sweetness; amazing expression... palate: amazing; again, this is decidedly apple-forward; no overt Berliner Weisse character, even the malt/wheat character is more full and (sourdough-)bready compared to a true Berliner; the aftertaste is apple flesh/skin, lemon juice, Boudin boule... textures: pillowy in body with a tart snap in the finish; inflated flow, lifting, palate airy 
 
Having now had 5 different fruited beers from New Glarus this week, I can't help but to declare them possibly the best fruit beer brewery in the States... I couldn't put this beer down, moreish to a T... no, this isn't a true Berliner Weisse, but this is utterly phenomenal work (2188)",4.52
Berliner Apfel,"Bringing cider over to the beer side of the drinking fence, New Glarus takes their premiere fruit series of beer to the tart side with the help of copious amounts of green apple and spontaneous fermentation. 
 
Starting with a shallow golden straw color and basically clear, Berliner Apfel starts with a foamy head that shows a zesty and sparkling pep that dissipates rather quickly. As a sparkling cider appearances takes hold, a sour ale-like maltiness shows up first in aroma, with a slow rise of sourdough, taffy and yes... apple. Flavors follow suit with a skim malt balance, scant sweetness and dough. 
 
As the ale washes the middle palate, its apple taste blends well with the suggestive juiciness of pear, lemon, lime, gooseberry and passionfruit. For a simple and less complicated taste, the ale layers its flavors very well without ever loosing its tart balance. Winey, spritzy and decidedly cidery, this apple heavy beer takes on a acidic taste and texture but not without a persistent balance of sourdough even late in taste. 
 
Crisp, clean and simple in its flavor profile, the uncomplicated session is an elevated cider with beery roots, perfect for a refreshing session of apple fans with a brief echo of sourdough and lactic acid.",4.01

Oaktoberfest,"12oz can pours a very light and clear golden-orange-amber color with a small fizz of off-white head that disappears pretty quickly. Smells of caramel and bready malts, as well as a slight noble hop and wood note. Normal Märzen flavors of caramel, toasted malt, slight sweetness, and nice noble hops. Almost tastes a little boozy, which is surprising for 5.2% ABV. A subtle but grounding wood note is strong in the background of the flavor and adds a really nice complexity. Medium body with a mild carbonation mouthfeel and a small, perfectly balanced bitterness. Some herbal flavors of the hops and the caramel sweetness form most of the aftertaste for a pleasant, but long finish.

Oaktoberfest,"Oaktoberfest from Firestone Walker. 12 fl oz bottles from Franklin Beer, Franklin, PA, 09/05/23. $ 10.00 (Including tax)/six-pack - $0.139/fl oz. Reviewed 15/06/23 (Review 3124). Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol. 
Bottom of label stamped “C7/22/22” On room temperature shelf at store. Stored at 34 degrees at home. Served at 46.2 degrees F in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 55.2 degrees F.  
Appearance – 4. 
First pour – Pale Gold (SRM 4), clear. 
Body – Gold (SRM 5), slight chill haze. Under direct light, same. When rear lite, same.  
Head: Average (Maximum 3.9 cm, aggressive center pour), baby powder, high density, quickly diminishing to a 0.8 – 1.0 cm undulating crown with a rocky cap.  
Lacing – None. 
Aroma – 4 – Virtually none – just a weak oak aroma. No yeast, no hops, no malt. No ethanol (5.2 % ABV according to the label).  
Flavor – 4.25 – Slight oakiness and light caramel malt. No yeast. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Weak gastric warming.  
Palate – 4 – Medium; approaching syrupy; soft carbonation. 
Final impression and summation: 4.25 The crispness is a bit lacking but the oakiness helps. Better than the average Märzen because it is slightly less sweet and better than the average lager because the oak ameliorates the hop flavor a bit. Some lacing would have raised the score slightly.",4.15

Oaktoberfest,"Clear light-amber, with one finger of off-white head.  
 
Smell is the usual combination of toffee and caramel, but lighter than is typical. Slight spicy aroma, plus some hints of oak, that seemed slightly vinous when first opened. Not apparent after the head fades.  
 
Taste is similar to aroma, with light spiciness, and a hint of fruitiness. Lightly-bitter finish.  
 
Feel is light-medium, with moderate, very,very fine carbonation tingle, that bites, in the back of the throat at finish.  
 
Overall, lighter and more subtle than a typical marzen. This is the last bottle of four, and the best, and have rated it as-is, without regard to the fresher specimens. The first couple seemed a bit too subtle, and bland. Either this is a better tasting night, or it has become a little more complex over the last 2 (3?) month.

Dragon's Milk - Crimson Keep,"Just a touch lacking in clarity for a red ale, strength and barrel aging notwithstanding. Strong head production, with good retention and lacing. Body is quite dark in color, appearing closer to a brown ale in dim light, but shining with an almost pinkish hue (lighter than ruby red) against bright backlight. 
 
Aroma prominently features bourbon, banana, toast, and caramel, an interesting blend from the malts, barrel aging, and yeast expression. Cola and prune emerge, but with a slightly brighter tinge than you get from stouts. There's an almost Fall or Winter aspect to this, as though subtle spices were added, although I don't suspect that's the case. 
 
The beer can't quite deliver on that complexity on the palate, although it's overall similar. A touch too sweet, bordering on cloying; I suspect this is partly due to the bourbon. Tasting notes of brown sugar, toast, caramel, prune, pepper, bourbon. 
 
Pretty easy sipper, appropriate for the style and ABV. There's some alcohol heat, but it's not overpowering. This is a beer you want to drink slow, but you SHOULD want to drink an 11% ABV barrel aged beer slowly.

Smell: Oak, a bit of vanilla, some mild malt and herbal notes.  
 
Taste: Malty, some toffee, some dark stone fruit notes, some oak, and a hint of vanilla. There is some booziness under all of this as well. There is a mild bitter finish....but I can't quite pull it out under all the other flavors.  
 
Mouthfeel: Good thickness, brisk carbonation, warming dry finish.  
 
Overall / Drinkability: A definite slow sipper, and it's an unusual mix of barrel aging and an imperial red ale, just minus all the hops. I feel like the hop notes (if they were there to begin with) got muddled. This beer has aspects of an English Barleywine, but it's not quite there, nor is it an American Barleywine either, and it's not an Imperial Red Ale either. I'd classify this more an an American Strong Ale. It's good, just not quite exactly anything I can put my finger on or identify. Let's go with unique.",4.04

A two inch off-white head rises above a clear red-brown nicely laced ale, The smell is pleasant, but faint. Notes of caramel, vanilla and cane sugar rise above the bourbon. The taste is less reserved, with the bourbon front and center over wheat and hops. Although boozy, I find the relative simplicity of the taste refreshing and appealing. There are no deep coffee, chocolate, hops, fruit or malt notes here, which are the norm in a bourbon barrel aged beer. It is clean, clear red ale that has been barrel aged, and I applaud this uncluttered presentation. I enjoyed Crimson Keep way more than expected, and overall, Crimson Keep is a keeper!",4.11
Dragon's Milk - Crimson Keep,"First time trying this Dragon's Milk, and the first time realizing that Dragon's Milk has become a sub-brand. Anyway, this is the Yang to the original Dragon's milk's Yin. Where the original is thick and sweet, here we have something a bit astringent and sharp. Both are 11% ABV, but Crimson Keep is much more dangerous. The original is thick and heavy, and hard to drink in quantity, while the somewhat lighter Crimson Keep goes down quick. I'm a big fan of the more bitter, ethanol tinged taste of this new offering. I recommend it, but be careful. 
 
Pours a cloudy copper red, with a nice lacy head. The smell is quite sharp and medicinal. It has a taste that is also somewhat coppery, and a sharp bite that's very nice.

Black Butte XXXV,"From a bottle packaged on 06/07/23 
 
Nice hiss upon opening with a bit of smoke coming out of the bottle. This beer pours pitch black, and even when I hold it up to light, nothing comes through. The head is thick at 3 fingers, and extremely long lasting. How can the head last this long in an 11% Imperial Porter? Once it finally dissipates, it leaves a nice bit of lacing on the glass.  
The aroma is quite powerful. I get tons of caramel, chocolate, molasses, coffee, plum, raisin, vanilla and cherry. These aromas are well balanced, and work very well together.  
Wow, the flavor the cherries start it off and linger throughout. They fade a bit as the rest of the crew comes into play. Lots of chocolate, caramel, dark fruit, molasses, coffee all work their way into the party. The finish is where the vanilla shines as it works with the cherries. There's a tartness from the cherries that cuts into the sweetness that this style can have. It provides a nice counter balance.  
Thick and full bodied overall, not Imperial Stout levels, but very full for a Porter. Getting the faintest hint of heat from the alcohol. Smooth feeling.  
Overall this is an astounding beer, in a good way. Quite happy and impressed with it.",4.48

Black Butte XXXV,"In thirty-five years of playing with porter, imagination and creativity run amuck as elements of cherry, cocoa and vanilla add tangy balance and curiosity to its imperial toasted dark ale of succulence. 
 
Just the slimmest shade off from black, its near-onyx body is capped with a tan whipped mocha froth that sturdily holds onto the glass during the patient session. With strong coffee, cocoa and burnt toast hovering above the rim, its tangy dark fruit scent is highlighted by its tingle of bourbon spice. Its full and deeply penetrating taste is of wonderfully burnt sugars leading with molasses, baker's chocolate and latte early on the palate. 
 
With earthen elements of coffee, soil, smoldering embers and burnt bread seeping into the mouth; the brilliant vibrancy of cherry seem to bounce off the tongue with its mild acidic balance. Soothing with vanilla and lingering caramelization, the taste eventually turns coffee bitter with smoldering embers, booze soaked oak and nuances of toasted coconut. 
 
Bittered with coffee and campfire, a burnt pinecone taste pulls from the ash and achieves a slight semblance of dryness with spicy bourbon into a finish that echoes chocolate covered cherries in long waves of aftertaste.",4.25

The cherry only emerges on the finish to me, and isn't distracting at all, more of a hidden nuance than an overt addition. There is an impression of booze that blends with the oaky vanilla and earthy wet tobacco leaf, with that cocoa present but never in a sweet, confectionary way...nice hints of smoke and char too...drying and bitter at times, but that keeps the palate moving in an appropriate way.

L- Black to the eye, held to a halogen it's a super-dark red-brown. Pours with a 3mm fine-bubble pale tan head. 
S- Quite bright and vinious... is this aged in wine barrels? ... 
T- It definitely has a fruity/wine side to it... then I start wondering just wine, or wine plus a hint of brandy ie it's quite a pungent/'ABV%-ey' facet. 
F- It doesn't taste like a typical Belgian Quad, the wine edge is prominent here. It's all in pretty pungent, one for slow sipping, esp in winter/colder months. 
O- Well it's a tasty beer, but for me the wine notes are a bit too prominent. The adage from my youth was 'Enjoy the grape (wine/brandy) or the grain (beer/whisky etc), as never the two will meet'. I.e. mix them => hang-over from hell. And that seems to be true. So beer tasting of wine is a bit strange for me.

Oktoberfest Märzen Lager,"Poured from a can into a pint glass 
Appearance – The beer pours a deep amber color with a small head of off-white foam. The head has a decent level of retention, fading to leave a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. 
Smell – The aroma is heavy of a caramel and bready smell with light notes of toast and dough. Mixed with these smells comes notes of apple and pear as well as a touch of earth and some floral hop. 
Taste – The taste begins with a rather clean brady and doughy flavor mixed with some caramel and toffee sweetness. At the same time there is a touch of nuttiness and a little bit of apple and pear. As the taste advances the flavors take on a touch more roastiness and graininess while the sweet and doughy flavors dwindle a tad. At the end, herb and earth join in, leaving one with a slightly more crisp (for a marzen) and rather clean taste to linger on the tongue. 
Mouthfeel -The body of the brew is medium in thickness and creaminess with a rather moderate carbonation level, bot of which suit the flavor profile rather well, and both of which make for a very easy sipper.

Pours a cloudy brownish orange with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

It leans a bit sweeter in taste, but it’s still very solid. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting wheat bread, toasted grain, floral hops, pear, sweet honey, and light pepper. The swallow brings notes of biscuity malt, wildflower honey, pear skin, floral hops, light toast, and toffee

Pours a crystalline caramel-copper with two-plus fingers of rocky suds. Retention is good, leaving robust streaks of foamy lacing. Colour-wise, it's sort of midway between what I'd expect a märzen and a festbier to look like. 
 
Nose is bready-malty and somewhat reminiscent of a caramel apple. 
 
Taste has more of a sharp, earthy bite to it than what I'd smelled. Tasting brown bread and apple, caramel, nuts, tea and tobacco. There may be a subtle, slightly sweet, pine needley aftertaste that’s hard to account for but only mildly discordant and really more of a curiosity than anything else. 
 
Feel is smooth and slick, somewhat full bodied relative to the style with fine, tingly carbonation. A little more carbonation would have been welcome considering it’s heft. 
 
Overall, a credible Oktoberfestbier. A somewhat Americanized take on the style - despite the claim of being ‘brewed with all German ingredients’ - but not outrageously so. It’s probably a little too thick if it were my intention to drink all four cans in one sitting. Not that that’s ever really my intention. It just sort of seems to happen.",3.74

Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Barleywine,"Pours a dark burgundy-brown with a finger of khaki foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is toffee, raisins, molasses and caramel with toasty, caramely, earthy malts behind. Bourbon adds a little swell of heat, but it's not much. Char cuts the bravado from the initial sweetness, shifting the end of the nose to a rather sharp cutoff. Flavor profile is molasses, fig, toffee and chocolate all dipped into sweet caramel. Toasty, nutty and caramely malts add base while bourbon adds a little tangy heat and substance to the sweetness. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a firm effervescence. Overall, sugary and sweet - sure - but bourbon swoops in to add a drop of heat and enough dryness to soak it all up. Dynamic and flavorful.

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's poured a very hazy deep chestnut colored brown body beneath a short head of khaki colored foam. The aroma is quite rich with malt and oak. It's woody and toasty with some Bourbon and butter cookie notes over medium-dark caramel and crusty bread that's topped with warm nuts and drizzled with molasses. (That actually took me some time to put together, so it's not exactly stream of consciousness.) Wow, what a great aroma... let's see how it tastes... well there's some alcohol to it, that's for sure, and it's not as rich as the aroma suggests. The alcohol cuts through the malt straight away and follows through to a dry, semi-hot finish that leaves some bitterness lingering. So how strong is this? I'm not finding anything listed on the label. Ahh, their website says 13.8% and I can believe that. It's a bit much I think. Back to the taste, there's some raisin, brown sugar, and coconut in there as well. I appreciate that this is not too sweet, but at the same time I find it a little too dry with bitterness (80 IBUs) and alcohol ~ mainly the alcohol. In the mouth it's medium-full and moderately zesty. The head didn't hold up very well, and as you might have expected given that, the lacing was limited.

Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Barleywine,"I'm probably ranking this too low for the style, but a bit too much for me. Choosing to sit down with this is akin to skipping another cocktail, rather than a beer. Boozy thickness throughout, warms the chest. Just a bit to syrupy for me.",4.12
Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Barleywine,,4.33
Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Barleywine,"CWs Barleywine pours a slightly muddled brown tinted by caramel and fiery orange highlights. A thin khaki foam develops then descends into a creamy looking hairline hugging the perimeter of the glass. A film swirls in the center. 
 
Bold aroma dominated by burnt brown sugar with molasses folded gently in. A splash of vanilla and pre-baked cinnamon rolls are finished off with damp oak. 
 
Sweet, caramel drizzled figs are quickly displaced by bitter dried orange peel. The oak and bourbon are intense, and the alcohol flavor lasts the entirety between sips. Mulling spices come in and out, but develop as it warms. 
 
Pretty rich, silky feel which ends up being an afterthought to the boozy warmth. The sugary sap coats the lips while a burn and bitter bite fill the chest and mouth. 
 
This is a sipper with an enormous alcohol presence. Delicious throughout and a real treat. Central Waters delivers another beauty from the Brewers Reserve Series.",4.24

Overall: exceptionally woody; would likely benefit from some aging.",3.94
Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Barleywine,"Pours a nut brown colored beer with a smaller, mohagony colored head. 
 
On the aromas, old, spicy oak is very well pronounced, blending together with sweet toffee and lighter molasses. This got a glazed caramel sweetness atop, balanced by matured hops and anise. 
 
Has a fuller body, with a velvet mouthfeel, finding almost no need for any carbonation at all. This is a beer, best enjoyed in a slow pace.  
 
Tastes of a pungent barrel integration from the get-go, accompanied by bakers chocolate and subtle earth, feathering the uprising barrel heat perfectly. Turns sweeter and hotter then, with toffee, licorice and caramel malts getting entangled into burned coconut, bitter, matured hops and warming, biting oak. Finishes with a mellow relief, more toffee, bakers chocolate and maintaining Bourbon, lending a long lasting, dry aftertaste to the flavors, balancing the sweetness in this very well. 
 
This aged tremendously well, providing an awesome balance and depth, making this a perfect winter sipper.",4.43
Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien,"2006 vintage.

This one comes under the heading, don't judge a book by its cover. The look and faint aroma didn't promise much, but the taste certainly delivered. Strongly sour and tart, lots of dark skinned fruit, sweetness buzzes in and out. Abv invisible, could not believe it's an 11.0.

The nose is intense and insanely good. Tons of sour and funk. Tart. Sour cherries peaches, red wine, lemon, floral, and rhubarb.  
 
The taste is really interesting. The lack of carbonation really makes it punch hard. Tart cherries, lemon peel, funk, sour, oak, red wine, and a slight nutty flavor. Really nice. The alcohol is high but not detectable in any way.

Gouden Carolus Cuvée Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,,4.44
Gouden Carolus Cuvée Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,"Can’t believe I haven’t rated this classic before. I’ve definitely had it in the past but not for years so I picked up a nicely priced (10.99) corked and caged 750, bottled in 2021. 
 
This beer looks phenomenal, with a very dark brown body (approaching black) and a tan head of tightly clustered bubbles that retains strongly and leaves creamy sheeting on the inside of the glass. The smooth fullness of the body, with moderate carbonation, is also a very high point. I was actually surprised at the restrained effervescence as for me it’s dead on and lively without getting too spritzy which I’ve encounter with many other Belgian beers. I actually uncorked this near the sink to be on the safe side but no issues whatsoever there.  
 
Nose is the weaker side of this beer, nothing bad here but simply understated and mild, hints of dark chocolate, bready malt, restrained alcohol, raisin. On the palate the alcohol is again present but contained in a very pleasant way, sweet dark fruit and chocolate predominant, subtler vinous qualities and suggestion of baking spices. Unfolds gradually revealing depths of flavor as it warms. 
 
What a treat. I love to mix it up with an old school European classic now and then and this fit the bill fantastically on a chilly early spring evening.",4.3

Gouden Carolus Cuvée Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,"Appearance: Served up an opaque, mahogany-toned body dressed with a persistent, lofty, beige head with a lovely-looking sheets of lacing on the way down. 
 
Smell: Spiced plum-infused port with a gooey brown sugar glaze atop a dark pumpernickel breadiness garnished with a sliver of bitter orange. 
 
Taste: Broiled brown sugar and treacle with a dash of chocolate powder - soundly sweet. Dark bready, toasted quality. A hint of vanilla with spicy touches of cinnamon, mace and pepper aided by the firm, mature, guiding hands of the warming alcohol presence. Dark fruitiness accented with some berry notes. Rich, slightly sweet finish. 
 
Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium carbonation. It's just sticky enough and lush enough. 
 
Overall: Hearty, nicely complex; makes for a solid sipper.",4.22
Gouden Carolus Cuvée Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,"750ml bottle into a teku. 2021 release, a year old. 
 
Looks very nice. Almost black body, deep red wine when held up to the light. Decent tan head, replenishes well with each pour. Does shrink to a ring and faint covering, great lacing. 
 
Sweet caramel aroma, lots of dark skinned fruit a touch of alcohol. 
 
On tasting, first off, it's certainly on the sweet side, caramel and boiled candy. However, there are enough nuances to cut through this. Dark skin fruit, warming, and more to come in the finish. 
 
Mouth a little foamy, close to full. Finish very complex. Sweet caramel to be sure, but the warmth, fruit, dryness, even a light bitter touch are all enjoyed.  
 
Overall, a thoughtfully well made beer. Thanks to Het Anker for putting this out every year for us to enjoy.",4.2
Gouden Carolus Cuvée Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,"From the 750ml bottle in a snifter. This awesome brew pours a dark

foam that settles to a thick ring, thick clumping layer, and sports exceptional 
lacing. Nose of date, plum, fig, mulled prune, subtle alcohol ester notes, and  
sweet Belgian candy sugars / brown sugar. Flavors hit the mark with plum, 
fig, date, stewed prune, cola notes, dark cherry, cranberry, dark sweet bread, 
and dark Belgian candy sugars. Nice mouth feel; medium body, medium light 
carbonation that is nicely effervescent yet soft, and a sweet yet balanced  
finish that is all and all perfect.

I would prefer a bit more mouthfeel with a fruitier flavor but it is what it is and it's not bad. Worth trying.",3.74
Hazy IPA,"It's a pale yellow hazy with a white head. There's a little bit of citrus note in the aroma, but not a lot.

Hazy IPA,"From a 12oz can: 
 
Appearance: hazy yellow, good head. 
 
Smell: Mild citrus. 
 
Taste: A little hoppy bite at first, but then settles into the typical soft, mildly sweet citrus taste of most hazies. Maybe a touch more bitterness of citrus rind in the finish. 
 
Overall: Last beer from the Stone mix pack, hazies used to be kind of fun but I've had too many that give the same experience. This one from Stone blends in with the pack. The beer is fine but nothing too exciting.",3.53
Hazy IPA,"Stone! One of those OG brewers with the crazy devil logo. Man, that takes me back a couple decades or more. You're Not Worthy. 
 
Regrettably, in as lazy a segue as you're likely to see today, this bland brew is also not worthy. I mostly get watery bitterness, like a mermaid in unrequited love. Nelson dying in the depths of Victory, unable to savor the triumph at Trafalgar. A diver missing a podium finish for improper Speedos.

Hazy IPA,"Picked up a 6 of this the other day from the weird store in Fernley. So much out of date beer, but this was a new beer, so it couldn't be that old.  
 
Pours a hazy yellow color. 1/4"" white head. Nothing out of the ordinary going on here appearance wise. The aroma was kind of lacking, Sabro can pop, it didn't here. El Dorado and Azacca are noticeable but giving vague not sharp nor specific hop tones. If anything comes off like generic Citra giving some citrus of a sweeter variety. But also with some sawdust.  
 
The taste is equally ho hum. There is a light tropical juiciness coming through, but there is also a bitterness that doesn't jive well with the hazy ipa substyle. Its a definite walk back from the early days of Stone's hoppy goodness. Doesn't seem like it has a wheat/oat flaked base in addition to barley. Doesn't hit that smooth note. It was affordable, but far from inspiring. Kind of like a recreation use only person in middle age on a dating app. Yowza.",3.43

Hazy IPA,"A solid-but-not-for-me ""juicy IPA"" with orange and tropical fruit flavor and nose. Smells more fruity than IPA. Unusually ""easy-drinking"" for an IPA, which means that for an IPA lover, the aftertaste might be too bland and malty. There is some bitterness, but nothing highlighting any of the piney aspects of hops. This is the IPA for someone who likes Blue Moon. (Okay, maybe that's a bit harsh.) It's nowhere near as good as their other beers, but better for someone who finds Stone's style too aggressive. Disappointing for me, but I'd still drink this any day over most beer...",3.5

Hazy IPA,It’s not nearly as good as Sierra Nevada’s Hazy. But it’s not bad.,3.78
Hazy IPA,"Beer pours a hazy honey color with a foamy, soapy 4 fingers of white head. The haze is a bit light but definitely there. Heavy sticky lacing on the glass. 
 
Lots of tropical fruits on the nose. Mango, pineapple and guava like scents. Some pithy citrus as well. Faint hint of pine far in the background. 
 
Very juicy on the taste. Definitely getting the mango and guava type of fruits on the taste. A light hint of the citrus pith, giving it the smallest amount of bitterness on the finish. 
 
Mouth feel is a bit on the upward end of light. Not quite into the medium. Very light on the bitterness. 
 
Overall this is a quality IPA with light bitterness. Lots of juice notes. Not like a sugary juice more like a natural fruit juice. I understand companies move on but I still miss the Scorpion Bowl IPA. It was a nice juicy one like this with a bit more bitterness for a little bite. This is really a good IPA for those scared that the beer is going to be overly bitter because it is an IPA. Another job well done to Stone Brewing.",3.82

Berserker Imperial Stout,"Midnight black body with a tan shallow head. Roasted malts fill the nose but have molasses, earth, smoke and dark bitter chocolate supporting. Frankly, I am in love with how rugged the flavor complexion is of this throw back stout: roasted and earthy malt with accents of smoky coffee, tobacco and earth, meet dark chocolate and black strap molasses on the second half that just glob onto the palate. Taste is just that tick more intense while still being drinkable.

Pure Hoppiness,"This is a big, classic West Coast double IPA and it’s one of the best specimens of that species. Juicy, piney, and full bodied while achieving a dry finish.  
 
Smells of huge hops but not one fruity flavor stands out. Usually doubles don’t have as much hop scent due to all the maltiness, but this thing is “mega” hopped—dry hopped big time I bet. I get sweet malty orange spicy hops. Wow.  
 
On the tongue piney, orange zest hops and cracker bread and toasted malts. Finishes fairly dry despite the thick, wet feel it hits you with.  
 
It’s big, it’s flavorful and it’s pretty amazing.

Overall Impression:  
18 / 20 
 
A consistent aroma blend of clean pine resin, pineapple syrup, freshly ripped mint and cracked black pepper lead the way in the front of the nose. From 8 inches away, Tahitian vanilla bean pods, baked whole wheat bread, low sulfur notes and white grape-like fruitiness also appear. The white head does not persist but does create a fine foam above a slightly hazy, golden appearance. Flavors start as intense dank pine extract and continues into the aftertaste where it is accompanied by sweetened white bread, which keeps the bitterness in check with a moderate, throat-coating alcoholic warmth. The second sip showcases tropical mango juice before pine again dominates as noticeable alcohol warmth and low motor oil elements come through. Full body and full fat creaminess coats the mouth, and the medium-high carbonation and moderate hop mouthfeel close out the finish while alcohol tingles on the lips.“",4.21

Smelled wonderfully bourbonny and stouty. Wasn't flat but had lost an element of carbonation. Taste was nicely bourbon stout, not char or roast but a enough in that direction to let you know it was a traditional stout. Can't believe this bad boy has fallen so far in ratings over the years in the face of pastry stouts.

Appearance: Black and letting no light through, but very dark brown by the time I got to the bottom of the glass. Thin tan head, with some islands of lacing noted. 
 
Smell: Mostly bourbon. After warming it up quite a bit, I got some additional vanilla, something metallic, and a hint of roasted malts. Still mostly bourbon.  
 
Taste: Strong bourbon flavor - really dominates the rest of the beer. Some vanilla, roasted malts, a bit of dark chocolate, sweet malt, and lightly bitter finish.  
 
Mouthfeel: Good thickness, light carbonation, but quite warming from the alcohol.  
 
Overall / Drinkability: I'm guessing this beer is variable ABV each year, and this version was on the high side. I could feel it halfway through the glass. Pretty hot overall, and I suspect it may have mellowed out if I let it sit a year. Otherwise, good, but not great.

The mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with low carbonation and a semi dry finish. Overall, good. The low carbonation really throws this beer off. There's not enough barrel or ABV to counteract the sweetness with no carbonation causing it to feel syrupy and unbalanced.",4.12
Blackout Stout - Barrel-Aged,"22 ounce bottle, 2022 vintage, didn't see an ABV on the label. Nice to see this one finally get distributed! Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. I like the aroma, the brew smells like burnt/charred malt, vanilla, dark chocolate, coffee and some bourbon. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some oak, dark fruit and earthy flavors. Barrel character shows up more in the flavor. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's slick and smooth with a moderate amount of carbonation. I thought this was a good barrel aged brew, certainly worth picking up some if you get the chance!",4.35

Sanctification,"Dated 05/30/14 and stored in a box down in the dark cool basement. Poured in a fluted glass for a quick review.  
 
A sparkling dark gold pour that produces zero foam and nary a carbonation bubble. The weak cork pop kind of gave away the carbonation deficiency. The smell is mostly brett funk and some light fruit. A taste that begins with white grapes followed by some brett funk and a hint of musty wood. The feel is slightly acidic and dry.

HefeWeizen,"Pours a murky straw color. I'm disappointed in the head, particularly in its poor retention and hesitation to grow. The aroma is far superior, showing off clove, banana, and bubblegum in equal measure. Some nice wheat notes pop up after warming up a tad. Flavor-wise, it follows the nose, albeit not as intensely. The banana, clove, and bubblegum are all there, albeit muted. I also get some wheat flavor on the finish. Everything is properly balanced and where it should be, it's just that everything is at 60% intensity. The mouthfeel is oddly sharp, and honestly a bit watery. The carbonation is there, but the softness isn't...not at all. Did the DMV get a lesser batch or something? This is definitely not the #2 hefeweizen to me, and it certainly doesn't measure up to the best German examples. It's fine, though - I'd take it over quite a few American-made hefeweizens.",3.36
HefeWeizen,"On tap: 
Note: had can from same distribution as keg, and it didn't perform any better, in fact slightly worse. There are obvious differences in what others are perceiving, so maybe we just got a subpar batch in the DC area?? 
 
The beer allowed the bartender to fill liquid to the top of the glass. Even drinking it down a tad and swirling things around barely revived the razor thin ring of bubbles. The body was a fairly cloudy, pale bruised banana. 
 
The nose is of moderate strength, but has a banana bubblegum quality that is nice. A little bit of the banana comes through in the taste, but there’s also a lemon-spritzed grain flavor that is more prominent, as I started sipping. 
 
Allowing the beer to warm a bit (along with noshing a little food) opened up some more familiar Hefe notes. The banana and bubblegum upped their game a bit to replace the tangy lemon-like note I was getting, edging the beer towards the sweeter side of balanced. 
 
Overall, this still wasn’t wowing me, and I think the somewhat watery feel I was perceiving hurt it the most. I’d be willing to give this highly rated beer another try, at least, to see if maybe I was just a bit off today.",3.56

HefeWeizen,"When I first drank this - bought from an Exxon station of all places - I didn't know anything about beer. But I knew immediately this was something special, and it became my choice when I wanted to upgrade from a 40oz malt liquor. In the years since, I have learned to name the component flavors, and the processes that yield them in the brew, which I'm sure you can research. But that all seems beside the point. 
 
What is the point then? Simply: This is a smooth, tasty, complex beer. Very little compares in the US, and it's better than Paulaner. You can enjoy it slowly. You can smash it. Equally interesting to the scholar and the party animal. A ""desert island"" beer that would also work in the frozen tundra. The last beer you might ever need. The omni-brew.",4.65

12oz can served in something similar to a wineglass with no stem. Can is dated 02.14.23. Got it from @MrSandman101 in a trade. 
 
Pours moderately hazy, with a fairly small, foamy, short-lived head, which settles to nothing at all. There's a little bit of active carbonation that I can see. Smell is spot-on, yeasty banana notes, a little spiciness that makes me think of cloves. 
 
Taste is also spot-on, reinforcing what I got from the nose. There's also a nice grainy characteristic. 
 
Mouthfeel is leaning toward thin, feels pretty still. Overall...tastes good, smells good, needs some head retention -- it looks indecently naked!",3.7
HefeWeizen,"Date on can: 04/19/2023 
 
Pours a cloudy, golden orange in color with a finger thick foamy head that dissipates to a thin layer with time. Carbonation looks quite lively. There's a fair amount of lacing as you drink, although most of it slides down the glass. Pretty standard look for a hefeweizen, although I think the head could be a bit creamier and longer lasting. Nit-picking, though. 
 
Lots of banana, clove and bubble-gum on the nose. Bread and butter with a hint of spice. Not unlike banana bread. A classic hefeweizen aroma. 
 
Taste follows the nose pretty much identically. Banana, wheat/bread, clove, bubble-gum. Simple, yet refined, and very clean. 
 
This is medium bodied with delicately zesty carbonation and a tiny bit of chewiness. I actually expected this to be over-carbonated, happy to report that it is not. However, I also expected this to be chewier, it feels a bit thin overall, though that does lend to its drinkability. 
 
This is a finely crafted Bavarian style hefeweizen. If you gave it to me blind, I would probably guess that it was from Bavaria, which is truly high praise. I doubt I could find a better brew of this style in the U.S. It won't be my highest rated for the style, but it's certainly up there. I must admit that I am not a huge hefeweizen fan, though I do crave them occasionally. This one drinks extremely smooth and clean. It is simple, but what's there is high quality. I've actually had this one several times but for some reason never got around to rating it. I did not realize it had such a high rating here, but it seems entirely justified. Live Oak continues to impress, I have not had anything from them that has been less than superior. Cheers!",4.37

Its all there, and its not totally disjointed, but doesn't really hit that Beatles like note of ""come together.""  
 
Taste, yeah, see, this just kind of tastes like an imperial of their barleywine. Rather than the smoothness of a bourbon barrel, you get amplified heat and bitterness. The 100ibu level of the base is just ramped up here. Like, I like American Barleywines, its my biggest complaint about BIL and their English barleywine kink. But this beer is evidence for their claims, not mine. I guess I just think one version is better barreled versus not barreled. The vanilla didn't pan out here.

DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),"(12 oz can, canned on 07/11/23; purchased cold single from brewery this week... poured into my Chouffe tulip) 
 
L: amber-colored, mostly-clear liquid; ultra-tight, jiggly white foam... head settles into thin collar, lacing in long, thin drip bands 
 
S: blackberry taffy, fruity pancake syrup, apple-berry fruit rollup, hint of lavender... one of the more unique IPA aromas I've ever sniffed... perfumy subtle alcohol highlights... altogether potent, if rather hazy/muddy in expression 
 
T: much of the same on the palate; almost green oniony spice buzzing in the aftertaste... berries, currants, drenched in citrus peel oils... I can't help but suggest this has rather English strong ale hop/malt character/interplay; malt has perhaps a delicate honeyed bran muffin note to it 
 
F: aside from its near bracing bitter sting, amplified by the ethanol and a soft carbonate sizzle, this drinks like a light-medium-bodied white wine... slight singing heat builds on the palate roof over time 
 
O: a lot of their beers have a distinct flavor to them, and this is no exception... a uniquely flavored IPA that drinks like a (hop) resin-ravaged tripel (2190)",4.31

DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),A rice ipa. Super clear golden. Looks like a budweiser but with a nice lacing. Smooth slightly sweet. Kuhnhenn call it west coast ipa but the high ABV and sweetness covers up much of the bitterness. Very good but not a classic west coast. Reminds me of a Founders Hopslam. Tender says they get that comparison often but that Kuhnhenn came out with the DRIPA five years before Founders figured it out!,4.58
DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),"12 oz can from Tavour. Hazy golden pour, fizzy head. Aroma is hoppy and lghtly fruity. Taste brings smooth malts with a huge hoppy bite. Light orange, minimally sweet. Bitterness stays on the palate. Sublime, smooth and strong.",4.01
DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),"Appearance – This is a very hazy dull yellow with a nice off-white head that dissipated rather quickly. 
 
Smell – The big lemon stands out in this unsweetened fruit nose. Lots of citrus and a bit of straw. 
 
Taste – More lemon at the taste and a bit of malts that were hard to find at the nose. The hops are resiny with a hint of pine and very little sweetness. 
 
Mouthfeel – This is medium-bodied and extremely dry. The dryness is massive at the finish, probably too much for the uninitiated. 
 
Drinkability – Good thing the bitterness slows you down because at nearly 10% ABV it is a heavy hitter.",4.17

Cuvée Saint-Gilloise,"(~5 oz tiny snifter draft pour at Monk's for Zwanze Day 2022... review copied from scant notes taken on my phone) 
 
pale, bitter, palate numbing... 
 
what I can add from memory: somewhat tart and biting, but lines were blurred with its sedate, subtly herbal, delayed bitter hum... took my time sipping this one, trying to delineate where the funk ended and hop infusion began... cloudy in appearance and expression... I'd of course be curious to try this from a bottle decant... decent opener for the event (2037)",4.01
Cuvée Saint-Gilloise,"Pours a hazy gold, 1"" white head, mild lacing. Nose is hairspray, lemon, hay, and lots of barny, wet funk. Taste follows forward with sweet, mildly tart white wine, lemon, but little expression of the funkier elements on the nose. As it warms, the sweetness and tartness of the wine continue to open, but little in the way of earthy, funkier elements. Feel is smooth with moderate carbonation, but it drinks cleanly and invitingly. Overall, however, lacking in some complexity on the palate.",4.03
Cuvée Saint-Gilloise,"2019 Vintage; Stored under okay conditions (Stable environment, very little light) 
The beer pours a nice off-white head that forms at a moderate pace: not too fast but gradual. The beer itself is a clear metallic amber color that looks very good. 
 
The smell is absolutely wonderful. It starts off with light strawberry notes while cold and warms up to let through a variety of citrus fruit notes such as grapefruit, orange, a light lemon, and hints of lime that pop in and out. The funk note is moderate with hay notes to it. 
 
The taste is very good. It has a strong citrus fruit note upfront that consists of grapefruit and a stronger lime note than in the smell. The funk shows up mostly as a musty hay not with a acidic tartness to it. 
 
The feel is good. It has a light to medium body and moderate carbonation. It has moderate acidity. 
 
Overall, a delicious cuvee worth getting and holding for a few years in ideal conditions ( away from light and stable temps).",4.46

Raspberry Eisbock,"(375 ml bottle, 2022 vintage; purchased cold at the brewery last week... poured into tulip glasses) 
 
Pours a touch cloudy; red-brown liquid, little foaming... raspberry juice dominant, with a touch of brown bread on the nose; mellow expression of perfumy brandy-like booze... on the palate: notably booze-forward, but not quite vinous-like; raspberry-dominant, but never even moderately sweet; the fruit and base beer seem to fight for contrast, a muddy affair that thankfully opens up and gains more depth over the course the journey through the glass... textures: lager-like clean finish, body attenuated in part by the hefty strength; warmer, the flow starts to develop a delicate roundness, but the palate is repeatedly stunned by hot flashes of ethanol... grateful for finally having tried this; while it does offer some interesting sensations, its taste leaves much to be desired; I would definitely try their other flavored eisbocks regardless (2191)",4.19

Smells incredible. The second I pull the cork, the room fills with the smells of cold cherry pie, lemon juice, muddled stone fruit, rustic barnyard hay aromas, oaken barrel staves, wild blueberries, dried vanilla and cookie dough. 
 
Tastes of intense lemon, black cherries, sliced peach and apricot, more vanilla oak notes, mixed berries, faint chocolate and more musty barnyard notes.

Nose expresses an abundance of raspberry (surprising, given the age), as well as a hint cocoa in the background. Taste consistent with nose; however, oxidation has definitely set in and there are some vinegar notes at the finish. Mouthfeel is light in body with a still carbonation. Overall, interesting and still complex, despite being past it’s prime.",3.76
Raspberry Eisbock,"Purchased this one at the brewery and muled it back home in my luggage. No ABV on the bottle. 12.7oz bottle, capped and waxed (red wine colored). Poured into a small-stemmed tulip. 
 
I love this beer. The oxidation is what struck me at first, but the raspberry makes more of an impression as the session continues. 4.5 
 
A – Pours a dark amber with a wine impression. Clear with a very small tannish head that disappears quickly leaving a ring around the glass. Average lacing and good viscosity on the glass. Looks like an old ale. 4.5 
 
S – Raspberries, but not overwhelming. Some vinous qualities and oxidation like an old ale. No noticeable hops. 4.25 
 
T – The ABV is slightly noticeable. Raspberry is faint and much less than perceived in the aroma. Very wine-like. No noticeable bitterness. Faintly sweet, which only adds to the taste and the drinkability. 4.5 
 
MF – Medium bodied with a semi-dry finish. Some very minor astringency and even some citric acid at the end. 4.75",4.47
Raspberry Eisbock,"2016 vintage 
 
Now this is a beer I’ve wanted for a long time. Kuhnhenn doesn’t distribute out in Mass, so I’m thrilled to finally get my hands on this, the highest rated Eisbock on BA. Eisbock is a style I’d love to find more of in general, but one this highly regarded is exciting. Let’s pop it open 
 
Pours a muddy brown with a finger of off white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing 
 
Wow, the nose on this is incredibly expressive and spirit driven, it’s so complex. I’m picking up on aromas of tart jammy raspberry, cherry cordial, milk chocolate, sweet caramel, port wine, brown bread, raisin, nutty malt and sticky molasses 
 
It loses its tart edge in taste, and maybe that’s a function of its age, but it is still complex and tasty. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting jammy raspberry, cocoa powder, brown sugar, sweet wine, fig, and brown bread. The swallow brings notes of cherry cordial, cocoa powder, port wine, sticky molasses, jammy raspberry, toffee, and earthy wood 
 
A medium body pairs with very gentle carbonation, resulting in a boozy and slick beer. Finishes neutral with a little tingle, but drinks well below the listed 15.5% 
 
While the taste was lacking a bit, this was still a fantastic beer! I definitely need to get my hands on a fresh bottle some day. It is very close to a liqueur or just a straight up raspberry filled chocolate, but the complexity sets it apart",4.42
Raspberry Eisbock,"poured from a 375mL bottle into a snifter. pours a murky, dirty ruby red with a finger of sandy brown foam head. raspberries aplenty on the nose. a tinge of chocolate malt and even a faint whiff of alcohol burn. more raspberries on the taste with a lovely chocolate and malty background. not that there is anything wrong with the nose but the flavors are so much more complex than the aromas would lead you to believe. really smooth for such a high ABV. thick, full mouthfeel. very hard to tell this one is 15%. it’s a sipper for sure, and while it carrie’s qualities of old ales and doppelbocks alike, it drinks like an 8% fruited stout. really interesting style of beer. hope to try more of this style.",4.43

Wisconsin Belgian Red,"(12 oz bottle, obtained at the brewery two days ago... poured into a clear, plastic cup) 
 
Compared to the Raspberry Tart, I found much more clarity and brightness in this liquid; foam built on the pour, but didn't persist long... on the nose: cherry cordial, pie cherries; bold and in 3D... on the palate: pie-cherry Heering, but not syrupy sweet; a Flanders red character slowly creeps up in the aftertaste over each sip, never subtly malty, but the dominant flavor is otherwise pie cherries... the balance this maintains in drinkability is remarkable; clean and almost crisp despite suggesting syrupy residuals; its body sports a lithe, drawn out curvature... another spectacular acheivement on their part, mesmerizing and moreish; another I haven't had in 9 years - glad I have some left!

Mirror Pond Pale Ale,"Re-reviewing this one as it’s been a dozen years since I last reviewed it. 
 
12oz can (5/16/2023) into a tulip. Pours a clear amber color with a huge billowing almost Duvel-like eggshell head with lots of sticky lace.  
 
Aroma is hoppy and grassy, floral. Piney Northwest hops, fragrant sweet malt.  
 
Taste is a blend of bready caramel malt and floral hops; light bitterness. Clean water. Nicely balanced. Very old school.  
 
Mouthfeel is soft, medium bodied, crisp, drinkable. Something about it is vaguely reminiscent of beers brewed with Belgian yeast. 
 
Overall a tasty, classic approach to the APA, one of my first go-to beers from the ‘90s. It’s somehow comforting to know that beers like this are still being made.

Rübæus,"Now, two twelve ounce brown bottles have been emptied into a clear glass liter mug. It was a foamy pour. There's just way too much just-off-white and pinkish tinted foam to make this a pretty pour. Just as the norm, this foam recedes unevenly and unattractively. Only in this case, it's a slow process. The color of the liquid body beneath all the foam is something in the dark copper-amber or light mahogany category. It will leave irregular glass lacing. As ugly as it looks, there is a nice raspberry/malt aroma that makes this appealing. It's opaque without being murky. The taste is a very nice delivery of raspberry within a brew that includes some hops, yeast and even a little malt. It's sweet, but not bothersomely so, with a finish that bitters and drys things out. The mouthfeel is surprisingly wonderful, considering all the initial foam. With the hop bite finish, this may drink more like a raspberry AIPA than a fruited sour. Its body is also better than most fruited sours and more like a nice AIPA. Whatever, if you like a good dose of raspberry in your brew, this is a good option.",4.17

The mouthfeel is good, balanced nicely between sticky and watery, but a bit cloying and dry on the aftertaste, which in this case, is not a bad thing... it emulates actual raspberries. Overall, I'm impressed. If I were to design a beer to taste like a robust raspberry brew, I would want it to turn out like this. Damn good beer!",4.24

The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with tart berry presence. The mouthfeel was medium in body and had good carbonation. Overall it is a great beer.,4.21

Anchor Porter,"Poured from 12-ounce bottle into a Willi Becher glass. Appearance leaves nothing to be desired. Cola-colored body with ruby highlights, a thick long-lasting light tan head, good retention and lacing. For my money, this reaches its peak at near room temperature. Roasty and a little bitter, with notes of caramel, chocolate, toffee, and dark fruit coming to the fore. Medium-light in body, with a bit of astringence and a sour note lingering on the finish. Overall, an outstanding beer. Hopefully Anchor will find some way to carry on.",4.06

Damnation 
Russian River Brewing 
Date: 08 May 2020 
Drinking through one of the lists on BeerAdovcate, this beer is next on the docket. I served the beer in a chalice around 46 degrees. The pour created a massive two-fingered creamy but airy white head. The retention is excellent, leaving gobs of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 8, dark golden yellow with amber hues. The clarity is clear with loads of carbonation. A beautiful appearance.  
 
The aromas in the beer are cloves, phenols, floral, toasted crackers, banana, a touch of funk, and earthiness.  
 
I taste cloves, phenols, floral, herbal, green grass, toasted crackers, bready, a hint of funk, orange, banana, and earthiness. 
 
The mouthfeel is dry and spicy.  
 
The body is medium, has high carbonation, and has a lasting finish.  
 
I was expecting a big, malty, and spicy Belgium beer. I got a lighter malty Belgium Beer with a dry, spicy finish. A unique take on this style. I enjoyed the differences in this beer.",4.27

Damnation,"I should issue a caveat. The bottle shop had this labeled as a Russian Imperial Stout. You stout drinkers can imagine my disappointment.  
It is not that this beer is bad. Looks, smells, tastes and feels like a Belgian. Not a particularly good one so I’m surprised by the ratings. It’s spicy banana Belgian blah blah boredom all day long. Almost as if someone said, “let’s brew a prototypical Belgian.” And strong ale? At 7.5%? I have had abbey ales at 10%+ with heavy duty sediments and incredibly complex flavors. Those are Belgian strong ales. Duvel, though decidedly weaker than some, is light years beyond this. The temerity!",3.03
Damnation,,4.48
Damnation,,3.5
Damnation,"Inspired by Duvel in style, Damnation exudes the Sonoma terroir: winey, yet wonderfully dry. 
The yeast reminds me of Belgium's passionate pints, particularly how the yeast works up the malts. And a dash of pepper. Spritzy. 
 
Because Russian River produces mostly world-class Wilds (and I shy from the style), I am glad to see their excellence applied to the BSPA. Preceded by two Bay Area cheeses, Damnation went wonderfully with an impromptu pasta dish with butter and Italian parsley.",4.23

Summer Shandy,"Poured from a 24oz can, best by July 17th 2023 
 
On a hard pour a good amount of head formed filling most of the glass, retention was decent, but after getting distracted the head was thin, but maintained a cap, then I poured the rest. Lacing forms at an average rate. Very hazy golden yellow body. 
 
Aroma is real almost fresh, lemon juice, which I appreciate a lot actually. A bit of sweet malt sits right behind the fresh lemon aroma bringing a definite sweetness. 
 
Taste isn't quite as bright as the aroma, eith zero tartness and a zesty lemon flavor that quickly leads into a sweet, malty and wheaty, but also plain American wheat beer base. Essentially zero hops. I want either more beer or more tartness from the lemons. This comes off as a bit sweet, but still has a refreshing summery character. 
 
The feel is actually quite nice. Outside on a hot day, straight out of the can, this is fantastic, but other than being a fancy easy to drink and maybe even chuggable lawnmower beer, it isn't really even worth it to pour in a glass. No wo der they only make it during summer. 
 
Overall this beer is very setting dependent. Out of the can while outside, this is a great radler, but out of a glass with dinner its a bit sweet and lacking in tartness for being a lemon radler.",3.27

Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,Super hazy bronze/orange color with a beauty of a head that retreats quickly with some lacing. The smell is that of clove and bread with that strange smell that others refer to a “banana”. The flavor profile is second to none in the wheat beer category with a spice and sweet wheat taste with that clove finish. The carbonation is spot on for this beer and I understand why it’s a crown favorite. Paulaner can do no wrong.,4.47
Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,Draft at Michael Collins in Barcelona,4.25
Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle, the body is a slightly hazy orange yellow. There is an initial fluffy head which quickly retreats to the glass edge. Modest lacing. 
 
Nose features clove, banana, and honey. Delightful. 
 
Taste follows nose but is toned down. Less honey (malt) in the taste. The clove and bubblegum flavors are light, not overdone. A wheat presence balances the flavors. Finish has a trace of bitterness or spice. 
 
Good carbonation and mouthfeel. Soft and easy drinking.",4.27
Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,"A true classic that did not disappoint. Is this the first time I had this beer. No, but one I haven't had in a while and pulled the trigger on a six pack. The spice is unmatched and the flavor profile is just when you need after a round of golf in the beating sun. This isn't something I need to have three of in a sitting, but if you looking to just have a nice porch sipper, this answered the bell.",3.89

Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,"16oz can into a tall glass. Best by 7/25/23. 
 
Darker body than most hefes, decent head and lacing. Strong banana aroma, clean wheat. Nice banana taste to it, quite clean. Does feel a little dead, likely due to it being 11 months old.",3.83
Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,,4.75
Anchor Porter,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. 
The body is inky black with a half inch of brown head with a mild pour. Retention is average. 
The intensity of aroma is medium. There are notes of malt, salted toffee, rich dark chocolate and black coffee. It smells wonderful.  
The intensity of taste is medium high with a dryer and more hoppy flavor than the aroma suggests. Normally, I loath hoppy porters, but Anchor got this one right. With a swallow, the flavor keeps going. There are flavors of toffee, deep dark chocolate, more black coffee than in the aroma and a long pronounced hoppy flavor that's medium in intensity. It's rich and delicious. I've missed having a go to dark beer after New Castle changed. This will likely be it's much better replacement. I usually support local Austin breweries, but this is a much better beer than 512 Pecan Porter which is much more expensive for a four-pack compared to a six-pack of this. 
The thickness is just under medium. It's quite dry with a low level of astringency. Well, I finished the bottle before I could accurately detect the level of creaminess. With it's 5.6% ABV, I'm feeling a little numbness in my face. I will open another bottle tomorrow to finish this.  
The level of creaminess is high. The carbonation is unique. The bubbles are tiny and tickle the tongue creating a effervescent quality. It has a lot of world class qualities in the mouth feel alone. 
Overall, I'm amazed by how excellent this is. After trying a few beers that I didn't care for, Anchor Porter reminded me how truly great a beer can be.",4.72

Anchor Porter,"From the 12 oz bottle in a snifter. This classic pours a dark blackish brown with  
a very nice head of khaki foam that settles to a thick ring, thin clumping layer, 
and shows off some nice lacing. Nose of dark coffee, dark cocoa, moderate char,  
and roast with subtle dark fruit hints. Flavors hit the mark with dark fruit notes 
of black and raspberry, dark cocoa, dark coffee, char, and balanced sweet  
caramel malts. Nice mouth feel; medium full body edging towards medium,  
smooth, lightly coating, light carbonation, and a balanced char and roast finish 
that is lightly dry.

Honker's Ale,"The first beer of my trip to Chicago for Riot Fest! Honkers is one of those beers always spoken fondly of by old school BAs, and I figure there’s no better way to start off the trip than with this beer I don’t see in Massachusetts. Let’s dive in 
 
Pours a cloudy deep orange amber with 2 fingers of light tan head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing 
 
It doesn’t have all that much presence in the nose, but what’s there is pretty good. I’m picking up on aromas of biscuity malt, floral hops, lemon zest, honey, and light pepper 
 
It’s a bit more expressive in taste, but still not a punch in the face or anything. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting herbal hops, crackery malt, honey, orange zest, and green tea. The swallow brings notes of black tea, floral hops, biscuity malt, honey, toasted grain, and light orange 
 
A light medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a crisp beer. Finishes mostly dry but a bit watery 
 
This is nothing amazing, but I wasn’t expecting anything amazing. This is a mediocre example of an old school style from a bygone era. That being said, it’s still a really enjoyable beer to drink despite its flaws",3.71

It has a bite when first taking a mouthful, but finishes nicely. The cherries are noticeable at first, but after having more than one beer in a given setting you don’t really notice the cherry taste anymore. Hence it’s not very vibrant it’s just there.

Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,"12oz bottle, tulip, best by May 2023. An office Christmas gift as part of a mixed six.  
 
The color is rather golden, with perhaps a nod of pink, though that could simply be the suggestion. The head was average and not long lasting.  
 
I smell beer and cherry smoothie. I find the cherry aroma pleasant and real, though it’s more like real cherry ice cream or a smoothie than fresh cherries. Sweet, creamy, fruity, small tang.  
 
The taste very much follows; cherry yogurt, pale wheat ale base. There is some bitterness to the finish, which is mostly clean with a lingering sweetness like from one of them flavored sparkling waters that’re all the rage.  
 
Moderate body and carbonation. You can tell there’s wheat in it by a slight matte feel to it.  
 
I’m a bit surprised given the reputation this beer at least used to have on this site. I’d say a good word to describe it is “pleasant”, as long as you’re in the mood for something light and fruity. C’mon, it’s clearly for non-beer drinkers or beginners.",3.62

Raspberry Tart,"Appearance: Dark ruby, good light pink head. 
 
Smell: Raspberry and pretty strong tartness. 
 
Taste: Tart and acidic with the raspberries in the background. Mix of tart and raspberries in the finish. Light bodied. 
 
Overall: The other mainstay fruit beer from New Glarus, Raspberry Tart follows its name and provides a tart raspberry experience. I would have preferred more raspberry and less tart, but oh well. I prefer the Belgian red.",3.77
Imperial Stout,"L: Pours dark brunette. Forms a thick warm tan head, fading slowly. A nice layer of foam forms on top of the snifter. Held to the light, this beer has a near-black, charcoal hue. 
 
S: Malt, chocolate. 
 
T: Roasted malt, hint of chocolate, jam, and a bit bready. Thin. 
 
F: Medium-bodied, pretty light. Some carbonation, crisp. Not similar to other imperial stouts. 
 
O: Imperial stout at 7%. Just about sums it up. It's not a bad beer per se, but it follows the original English tradition, which is to say lighter, less body, not as complex. There are better stout options available.",3.55

Imperial Stout,,4.48
Imperial Stout,"A: Pours up a deep reddish mahogany with a frothy three-finger beige head, medium retention, nice lacing.  
 
S: Immediate notes of chocolate followed my more muted hints of roasted malt, specifically not coffee but roasted malt, though some slight coffee notes do come out a little bit later, as do some biscuity notes and some subtle hints of vanilla.    
 
T: A warm bready sweetness greets you, followed by a somewhat jammy malt flavor that hints at chocolate without quite getting there, this is rounded out by some subtle hints of roasted malt and a crisp, slightly tart finish.  
 
M: On the lighter end of medium body, slightly over carbonated and a bit dry.  
 
O: This is a very good beer, but to me it suffers from what I might call “OG Syndrome”. What I mean by this is that how this style is understood has changed since this beer was first brewed but this beer largely has not, leading to a beer that misses the mark by no fault of its own. The beer has a surprisingly light body that one would not think of when one thinks of the style, and the dryness and carbonation are unwelcome by modern standards as well. I do enjoy this, but were I reaching for an imperial stout this would not be my first choice. It’s a bit too understated.",3.37

F-Medium bodied mouthfeel. Decently high carbonation. 
O-Ehh. I don't really get the hype with this beer. It's solid, but there isn't anything to write home about. For a surprisingly low ABV imperial stout, there was still a good bit of boozeyness on the pallet. Just an okay beer. Not sure if I'd try again.",3.61

Cloudy, raspberry red liquid; some lasting foam in the form of a collar... redolent raspberry on the nose... raspberry pie on the palate, fruit and dough; approaching fruit shrub in its acidity; mesmerizing dimension and expression of the raspberry flavor... the tart tingle invigorates my senses; its body has a lazy plushness to it, almost but not quite nectary... an aptly named beer; this was my first time having it in about 9 years, and I was in heaven; looking forward to sharing some with friends back home (2186)",4.7

Raspberry Tart,What do I say about one of the best beers of all time. It's a shame that it's only available in Wisconsin but probably a good one for my body since it would be stocked all the time if I could get it,4.72
Weihenstephaner Vitus,White fluffy head more than 2 fingers high slowly recedes to a ring and intermittent film. Some lacing. Minor to moderate haze. Banana esters on nose and taste. Really like the heavy body with trace of prickly carbonation on mouthfeel. Really like tis a lot.,4.57
Weihenstephaner Vitus,"Beautiful looking beer on the pour....gold color, big white head and lots of fluffy lacing. Aroma is fresh bread. Taste is wonderfully bold and fruity (citrus, banana, dried fruits), but the finish is creamy smooth. Tastes more like a fruity wheat beer than a bock, but this is a World-Class brew, worthy of its reputation. Weihenstephaner is my favorite German brewer and this is the best of the best.

Weihenstephaner Vitus,"Poured from 11.2 oz bottle to a weizen glass. Looks solid gold, slightly hazy, unless you swirl and add the sediment at the bottom of the bottle, then it gets pretty cloudy. Some carbonation bubbles popping up. White head falls to a thin cap. Some sticky lacing left behind in the glass. Smell is banana, clove, ripe apple, a slight citrus smell. Taste starts sweet and fruity with apple, banana, citrus up front. Middle of the sip tastes of clove, pepper, more banana. Finish is spicy with pepper up front, clove and allspice mixed in, maybe some cinnamon, and a long banana, clove, wheat cracker, peppery aftertaste. Feel is medium to full bodied, with a nice tight carbonation, almost coats the tongue. Feel is very smooth and easy to drink with a bit of alcohol warming in the end. Overall, wow! I really love this beer. So much flavor, so easy to drink. The ABV slows things down a bit, but this is worth taking slow. Honestly, I think I have a new favorite beer.",4.78

Raspberry Tart,"Poured from a 12-ounce bottle into a Zwanze 2018 logo stemmed goblet because it seemed like the right thing to do. The color approximates a murky and slightly watered-down cola, with a short snow-white head that left lots of spotty lacing. No question in my mind as to why this is among the top-rated beers of its style. It's fruit forward, with lovely aromas of raspberry jam balanced with notes of light breadiness. It's sweet, but not cloying. It's tart, but not overpowering. It has good carbonation and very low bitterness. It finishes perfectly dry. This made an ideal pairing with grilled chicken, and I could imagine that it would be absolutely stellar with crackers and aged Wisconsin cheddar. The only downside is that it's available only in Wisconsin, but who doesn't like a nice road trip once in a while?",4.7

The aroma kills; chocolate coffee, bourbon with the taste those same qualities, with a strong presence from the barrel, it’s like FBS on steroids, delicious, and oh so easy to drink at this high abv.

Big Bad Baptist,"Look: Poured from a 12oz can into a sniffer - Jet black pour with about a fingers length of foam risen to the surface. A bit of lacing is left behind as it dissolves back into liquid form. Pours quite thin for a 11.8%. 
Smell: Getting big notes of chocolate - rich baking chocolate. Getting some caramel and toffee as well as some molasses too. Not to much on the coffee notes here or bourbon/whiskey either. 
Taste: First you get a coffee aromic taste followed by the chocolatey that backs it up. The thing that stands out the most is definitely the chocolate. I'm getting hints of oaky-ness and vanilla as well. It's rich yet not to heavy in a sense that you can drink it easily. The alcohol is very well hidden and that's surprising being a 11.8% beer. I didn't get much of a whiskey taste in this and this might be due to ageing it for months in a barrel vs some places do years. Even though the whiskey/ bourbon barrels aren't to present but it's a very good sipper. 
Feel: This is so smooth that you can't even tell it's a heavy beer. It's not chewy or oily at all, very light carbonation - might throw a lot of people off by this alone yet so smooth. Easy sipper for sure. 
Overall: I was hesitant paying the price for a four pack but man I'm glad I got to experience this. I'll definitely be buying again and even aging some to see how it turns out.",4.63

Overall I think the feel distracts from the taste a bit, which is too bad because the balance of coffee and bourbon is phenomenal.",4

Feel is smooth, decadently rich, light to medium carbonation. 
Overall: Beautifully smooth coffee Stout sipper, very well-executed and balanced. One of Anerica’s Best.",4.62
Big Bad Baptist,"Pours black, gloriously dark with a wondrous two finger head of nicely bubbled foam. Aroma is strongly coffee and dark chocolate. I could smell this brew all day. Taste is not as carbonated as I thought, a light chocolate than anticipated and the coffee is likewise present, but subdued. None of this is truly as bad as it sounds, but is noticeable. This is very pleasant and for this ABV, very drinkable. An easy to like imperial stout.",4.43
Big Bad Baptist,"Rel #101. Pours a dark, dark brown with a faint hint of red. Fully opaque in the glass, with a think khaki colored head that quickly receded to a long-lasting cap. Aroma is really nice. Rich chocolate dominates, while the coffee and whiskey barrels have faded.  
 
Taste is almost the opposite of the nose. No direct coffee notes, but plenty of roast and some really nice barrel flavors. There's not much in the way of sweetness, but that's not at all a bad thing. This beer is several years old, and while I can't attest to what it tastes like fresh, it has a certain balanced mellowness to it that I'm really enjoying. Full bodied and smooth going down.",3.8

La Folie,"Tasted from a 500 ml corked bottle in a red wine glass. 
 
L - Beautiful ruby red color and very clear. Light tan head fades quickly to a thick ring around the glass and a few wisps on the surface. Swirling the beer reveals light lacing and ""legs"" on the glass like a strong wine shows. 
 
S - Nose is an interesting blend of sweet brown ale with red wine and berry notes, and a sharp, acidic note with some barnyard funk at a low level. 
 
T - The barnyard funk and sour acidity dominate the flavors, but is some depth that reveals other flavors. I get blackberry jam and oak, but the base of Flemish brown ale is not detectable to me. 
 
F - Thin body with low carbonation. Hops bitterness is not detectable because the acidic sourness is so strong it masks any other sensation on the tongue. It also give a sharp bite in the throat. Alcohol presence is also drowned out by the acid, except for some esters detectable in the finish.  
 
O - This is an unabashedly funky and sour beer, but totally over the top compared to the Belgian versions of Flemish Brown I've had. Still, this does have delicate touches that make it more than just a sour monster.",4.21

Curieux,"Very deceptive, very tasty... 
 
When I see a brew is barrel-aged, at 10.5%, and it has a taste that hints of the booze - I found it very deceptive, in a good way. The booze that I expected to taste and even smell - was basically non-existent. I find this to be well made for that fact alone. A tasty treat indeed that I would be glad to try once again.",4.1
Curieux,"Poured from a can into a tulip glass 
Appearance – The beer pours a clear golden color with a small white foam. The head has a fantastic level of retention, fading slowly over time and leaving tons of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. 
Smell – The aroma is big and bold with lots of candied sugar and biscuit malt. Mixed with these aromas comes a nice doughy smell mixed with lots of coriander and clove, along with a bit of nutmeg. At the same time notes of yeast and some peach and lychee are there as well. For a bourbon barrel aged brew, the bourbon smell is light, but adds a nice accent, mixing with the rest to produce a rather inviting smell. 
Taste – The taste begins with a nice crisp cracker and biscuit malt flavor mixed with some sweet grape, peach, and apricot flavors as well as flavors of candied sugar and yeast cake. Along with these flavors comes a decent showing of coriander and clove, with some lighter notes of white pepper and grain. As the taste advances the sweeter flavors get stronger, with some bubblegum and cane sugar joining in. At the same time a bit of grass and hay join in, and with a touch of bourbon coming on at the end, one is left with a nice, sweet, crisp, and flavorful triple like flavor to linger on the tongue. 
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is light for a 10.5 % abv brew, with a carbonation level that is high and effervescent. For the style and the taste, the feel is great and makes for a very pleasant sipper. 
Overall – While not very heavy on the bourbon at all, the brew is rather flavorful and tasty. A very nice, slightly sweeter sipper, and one certainly worth a try.",4.34
Curieux,,4.3
Curieux,"Interesting idea to barrel age a tripel, and the barrel notes are quite nice. However, I find the overall flavor profile lacks many of the qualities I'm looking for from a solid Belgian tripel in addition to being a bit too boozy for the style.",3.84
Curieux,"Pours a gorgeous slightly unfiltered golden color with a creamy white head that yields to the body of the beer fairly quickly. Beautiful tripel. The nose is crammed full of oak notes, with caramel and vanilla in plentiful amounts and a bit of bourbon and pear. I am literally drooling. 
 
That oak flavor is forward and melds well with the caramel and vanilla to provide a smooth foundation for the bourbon to provide a modest amount of booziness, but it’s the pear at the back of the palate that is knocking my beer nerd socks off. So many flavors and so well balanced. 
 
The mouthfeel is substantial and fairly crisp, making for an oxymoron of a beer - a crushable 10.2% ABV beer. This is exceptionally well crafted and a world class tripel that I am so glad I finally had the opportunity to enjoy.",4.5

Curieux,"lovely beer, citrusy spicey taste. scotch and lemon peel. very fresh for a tripel",4.5

Curieux,"This one has been on my list to try for a while. It's a tripel aged in barrels, which I guess converts it to a Belgian pale ale. Pours paler than expected. Fizzy and quick dissipating foam. Smells of cloves and typical Belgian smells. But then you get the whiff of the whiskey barrel. It’s like drinking Earlytimes on the rocks after all the ice has melted. And that's actually excellent. The barrel is pretty prominent especially in such a pale beer. You also get notes of vanilla and toffee(?). This is definitely a unique beer and glad I got to try it. Label is okay. A bit boring and generic but also dignified. It's fine.",4.25

Special Double Cream Stout,"Poured stout black and, much to my surprise, had virtually no head but left off-white lacing. 
The aroma was mild for my nose, but that’s normal. I did get that lactose sweetened malt and smooth coffee. 
The taste features malts galore, cocoa and chocolate and coffee and toast and the expected sweetness was present, just not as a major player. 
The feel was a bit thin for a stout, especially a double, but as the ABV makes it possible to drink more than one without falling over, the thinness works in its favor.

Special Double Cream Stout,"12 oz bottle 
Glass: Nonic Pint 
Temp at Pour: 47 F 
ABV: 6.1% 
 
 
Look: 
Very dark brown-to-black with some chestnut highlights when held up to a light. 1-finger dark tan/light brown head that quickly dissipates to a thing cover and then that begins to disappear. I suspect that the age of this bottle is a factor, here. 
 
Smell:  
Sweet roasted oats and rich semi-sweet chocolate. Touch of coffee here and there. 
 
Taste:  
Initial molasses sweetness is quickly joined by roasted oats and some char. The semi-sweet chocolate appears and transitions to bittersweet chocolate and obvious coffee notes emerge. Anise shows up near the end. Finishes on a sweet fading chocolate and molasses note. 
 
Feel:  
Smooth and creamy. Body is in the heavier side of medium 
 
Overall:  
This stout is a perennial favorite of mine. I pick up at least a 6 pack each year, if I can. The coffee and chocolate notes remind of coffee stouts, but are much less in your face. The heavier body is nice. Somehow, this particular bottle hid in the cellar for 2 years. It didn't last long after I found it.",3.87
Special Double Cream Stout,"L - black with mahogany highlights and a creamy tan head that dissipates somewhat quickly leaving behind some lacing  
S - notes of semi sweet chocolate, roasted dark malts, coffee - smell is somewhat faint  
T - follows the nose with semi sweet chocolate and roasted dark malts intermixed with sweet cream and coffee along with a somewhat nutty finish 
F - medium bodied with light to medium carbonation. Smooth and velvety, but a little thin on the finish  
O - a nice milk stout that doesn't really do anything wrong.",4.29
Special Double Cream Stout,"Poured gently from a bottle into a snifter glass, forming maybe a finger of tan head. Deep cola brown color. Smell is sweet/roasty oats. Taste is similar to the taste, just mostly roasty with some sweetness. Taste got a bit much after it warmed, wasn't a fan at all at that point. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A fine milk stout if you like the roasty nature.",3.62
Special Double Cream Stout,,3.42
Special Double Cream Stout,"It's a very good, strong and sweet stout, with the heavier body and roasty characteristics you'd expect from a stout, magnified with the extra maltiness and higher abv of a double stout. The hop, malt, roast and sweet flavors are well balanced, and overall, it's just all around an excellent beer. 
 
On the newer brown label, the words ""Double Cream"" are larger than the rest of the name, so the two of us read that as ""doubly sweet stout"" rather than ""sweet double stout"", which is what it actually is - a maltier, stronger version of a sweet stout. It's still a cream stout so of course it is sweet, but it's not dessert levels of sweetness, which is good, in my opinion. 
 
In other words, a Cream Stout is a sweet stout, and a Double Stout is a stronger, maltier stout, so this Double Cream Stout is both of those put together. It makes sense in hindsight :) 
 
I've liked pretty much every beer I've tried from Bell's, although they're the most expensive 6-packs you can buy (around here at least). When other craft beers were $10 for a 6-pack, Bell's 6-packs were $17, so I normally never buy them.",5

Plead The 5th Imperial Stout,"Plead the 5th from Dark Horse Brewing. 12 oz bottle. Stored at 34 degrees at home. Received from @Whyteboar in NBW BIF #16. Reviewed 07/12/22. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol. 
Undated bottle. Served at 53.7 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 58.1 degrees.  
Appearance – 3.5. 
First pour – Amber Brown (SRM 18), clear. 
Body – Brown (SRM 20), opaque. Under direct light, same, but much precipitate is present. When rear lite, opaque except at the edges – ruby and translucent.  
Head – Average (Maximum 1.2 cm, aggressive center pour), brown sugar, high density with many surface rocks, quickly diminishing to a 0.35 – 0.5 cm low-density crown and a thin island. 
Lacing – Surprisingly, a fair amount, extremely tiny bubbles forming a few small coronas. More than expected at 11% ABV. 
Aroma – 4.5 – Chocolate, weak char, and a hint of coffee. No hops, no yeast. 
Flavor – 4.5 – Chocolate and slight char with a slightly bitter aftertaste. No hops or yeast. No ethanol (11 % ABV as marked on label) aroma or taste. Slight gastric warming occurs. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl.  
Palate – 4 – Full, dry, soft carbonation. 
Final impression and summation: 4 (After deducting 0.25 point for undated personal container) Looks like every other RIS. Drinkability excellent, with nose and taste balanced, very smooth! Palate works well with the flavor.",4.29
Plead The 5th Imperial Stout,I am trying a can of this beer at my BRAH-in-law 's house whilst there for Thanksgiving. It poured an opaque dark with tan ring head that is not leaving any lace. The scent had dark chocolate and roast notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to sip. There was dark chocolate malt base with roast and espresso highlights. The mouthfeel was fuller in body and had good carbonation. Overall it is a solid beer.,4.27

Palate Wrecker,"Shared 12 fl. oz. bottle, kindly provided by abemorsten. ABV is 9.5%. Hazy orange colour, large white head. Strong aroma of orange marmalade and fruity and resinous American hops.

Aroma is sweet caramel malt with vanilla, resinous pine, grapefruit and other citrus with a hint of pineapple. Taste is hop forward resinous pine, grapefruit, lemon and orange pith and zest, backed by caramel malt sweetness with pineapple and spice (alcohol?) in a bitter finish. There is a tea-like herbal bitterness throughout. Starts bittersweet and finishes super bitter and dry. Aftertaste is resinous, oily hop bitter with some malt sweetness.

Daisy Cutter,"Poured from a freshness dated 16 oz. can: slightly hazy, deep golden-orange with a sustained, foamy white head. 
 
The aroma is mainly tropical fruit and some faint pine.  
 
The first sip, just after pouring into the glass, nearly took my head off because it was so bracingly bitter and seemed very thin-bodied. Please let this one warm in the glass for a few minutes before quaffing as it will calm the bitterness and give flavors of bittersweet tropical fruit and mango as well as hints of pine. This one drinks like an IPA to me. I prefer my pales ales less bracing with a well-rounded body. I'm still glad I tried it.",3.76

Daisy Cutter,"Can dated 7/6 (month-plus): 
Pours a amber nearing copper with a near clear body and a bunch of head. Lacing is a bit clumpy, but pretty strong. Nose seems trying to throw a little citrus into a grassy bitterness along with some grain dry toast. Taste opens with a bit of a grain tea from lightly toasted malts. This doesn't last too long on a cold beer, but lingers longer on a warming beer. Grassy notes from the aroma grow out of this fairly steadily and into full strength at the finish. A copper note leaks in on a cold beer, but isn't really noticed at all at the preferred temp. The beer is pretty dry, which seems to accentuate the bitterness, which turns a bit dank at the end and in the finish. This offering from Half Acre has more of an old school IPA vibe to it than an actual IPA of theirs I recently tried.",3.92

Taste bursts low and kinda dank. A wave of malt is in the mix. Nice balanced finish. Mmmm., really good dry finish.

Daisy Cutter,"This was from a bar, so it may have been served too cold. It has a transparent amber color, with a mix of hop and malt aroma. However, I don't taste much. There's a bit of watered down sweetness, but that's about all she wrote. For such a highly rated beer, I'm disappointed.",2.92
Daisy Cutter,"This is a review of a 16 oz can. From the bottom of the can: ""030 123B 3145 14:51 N95"" 
 
Appearance: The body of the beer is a darker shade of amber. It has pretty good clarity with only a slight bit of haze. There is a medium-large sized head which appears mostly white with a touch of a tan hue to it. It has excellent head retention which is probably the greatest feature of the appearance. The head overall looks really good on this beer. There are a few splotches of lacing that form on the glass but not many and they are separated quite a bit. 
 
Aroma: There is a light but present aroma of pine with a touch of caramel. A bit of an orange aroma comes through as well, which blends with the caramel scent. It smells nice. 
 
Taste: Up front there is a candied orange peel flavor with a touch of caramel. The middle of the palate has a biscuit flavor mixed with notes of lemon and lime. It has a touch of alcohol flavor and a bit of grass near the back of the palate. Some pine, grass, and a light bit of alcohol in the aftertaste. There is also a nice lemon and lime flavor in the aftertaste but it comes in after the other flavors fade out a bit. 
 
Mouthfeel: It has a medium perceived hop bitterness with a bit of a resinous texture to a body which feels medium-light at some points and medium at others. It is more textured and weighty than a standard Pale Ale. It also feels like the bitterness is stronger than average. It is still enjoyable to drink and it seems to fit this beer. 
 
Overall: The can states that this is a ""PALE ALE"" and doesn't appear to list an ABV. It is a nice beer that seems to drink a bit more like an IPA than a Pale Ale. It will definitely deliver some nice flavors like the biscuit character, some pine, some orange, and other citruses like lemon and lime. It also is a bit grassy and comes through with alcohol character. If you are an IPA lover who is looking for something with similar characteristics in a Pale Ale then you will probably enjoy this.  
 
If you enjoy a more tame and drinkable Pale Ale this might not be for you. I could drink it again but it wouldn't replace a standard Pale Ale if that was what I was looking for. This might be something I would buy if I wanted an IPA but wanted it to be lower ABV.",3.56
Daisy Cutter,,3.71
Daisy Cutter,"I guess I was expecting more. It is not my favorite pale ale. Poured from a 2 month old can into a Sam Smiths pint glass, it produced a good, but short lived head. There is something kind of funky about the finish, but the initial taste is pretty good.",3.83
Daisy Cutter,"Appearance: pours a pale golden color with a sticky off-white foam head. 
 
Aroma: citrus, pine, and caramel malts. 
 
Taste: follows the nose. Citrus peel, a little bit of pine and some caramel malts, well balanced. Some some moderate bitterness that lingers into the finish. 
 
Overall: This is a pretty solid pale ale. It's simple The characteristics in both the aroma and taste are well balanced. This one kills it with the drinkability.",3.77
Daisy Cutter,,4.59
Daisy Cutter,"Imperial Pint (Stovepipe) presumably canned on January 5th 2023, hopefully this isn't a best by, but if it is Please let me know. 
 
On the pour a very nice 5 finger white sudsy head formed then over a couple minutes the bubble got bigger and the head lost 2 fingers, so head retention is pretty good here. Body is a clear golden yellow, legit pale ale look. Sudsy lacing forms. 
 
Aroma is basically a bright slightly citrusy pine forest with hints of sweet wort and caramel malts. Super fresh and smells like pellet hops I've used while homebrewing. Perhaps an American and noble hop mix? Definitely fruity, but herbal as well. 
 
Taste follows the aroma, but is more bitter than a lot of NEIPAs out there. I can see why the American Pale Ale style is falling by the wayside in favor of session hazies. This is essentially a full flavored ""session"" WCIPA in terms of the bitterness, but being called a ""simple"" pale ale is still appropriate as after the citrusy and resinous bitter hops a lightly toasted and sweet malt backbone makes itself known. I'm honestly upset IPAs are taking over pale ales, since the latter is basically a balanced but bitter WCIPA when compared to a hazy/NEIPA. Anyways, I enjoyed this beer quite a lot. Hoppy but balanced by actual detectable malts. This is what craft beer was aiming to be about 10 years ago before everyone got bored of ""beer flavor"". 
 
Feel is full without being heavy. Feels similar to a 6% ABV IPA despite the lower ABV. Full malty body with light astringency in the medium long finish. Dries out over the course of a drink. 
 
Overall I greatly appreciate the balance of malt and hops here. This is what I always imagined ""malt backbone"" meant, but I''ve always been a malthead. At the same time, there is a solid resinous and grapefruit pith-y hop bitterness. Caramel malt sweetness without being even an amber beer. Good stuff.",4.15

Shock Top Belgian White,"12oz can 
 
On the pour not even 1 finger of average white head formed then in under a minute it completely dissipates. Despite that and my clean glass, bubbles cling to the side of the glass from excessive carbonation. Hazy golden orange body. 
 
Aroma is light for the style with hints of citrus, but no coriander. A touch metallic with a grainy finish. 
 
Taste is decent, with some nice but subtle orange flavor right in front of an almost sweet, wheaty malty body. A touch doughy. Really not bad, but not quite a full on belgian wit. 
 
Feel is highly carbonated and very refreshing. Much better when poured in a glass than when left in the can. At first it seems like its going to be full bodied, but the body quickly drops off as a dryness sets in. The wheat flavor stacks around for the finish, but this gets light fast. Basically a lawnmower beer. 
 
Overall this is decent for an AB product, but it's too expensive for what it is. I don't get any coriander, and the orange basically replaces any hop character. Not bad to change up the pace from lagers, but not something to give a shot if youn are looking for a quality Belgian style Wit.",3.15

The flavour is also citrussy, with moderate notes of banana and cloves. Fizzy mouthfeel.  
 
Original rating: 355 ml bottle, at Peter Gift, Aarhus, Denmark. Deep golden colour, no head at all in the shiny glass, probably due to the pub’s ignorant use of rinse aid / rinse agent.

A rough pour yielded a big khaki head; strong, frothy tree-rung lace.  
 
Fresh soap, mild corn & faint dry wheat notes in the nose.  
 
Sticky medium mouthfeel.  
 
Fresh soap & mild orange peel flavors up front; dry clove notes and some booze heat on the finish.  
 
A bit off-putting; not so much a melding of styles, as a clashing of styles. Abrasive.",3.5
Raging Bitch,"Poured on tap at DCA airport in DC. The beer is a clear dark orange color with a frothy off-white head. Strong Belgian yeast aroma with brown sugar and balancing malt. Taste is balanced with a slight bitter kick at the end. Like a Belgian funnel throughout, lots of brown sugar, caramel, banana bread, spice. Finishes with a surprising pine not which brings it back to the IPA aspect of things. A really fun take on a Belgian brew with a lot of similarities but also some surprises. Recommended.",4.25

Freshest By 07/10/2023 
Consumed On: 08 March, 2023 
Glass: Troeg's 0.4 L Tulip 
ABV: 11% 
 
Look:  
Clear amber with bubbles continuously rising. A 1-finger hight beige/light tan head quickly dissolves to a ring and filmy cover leaving OK lacing. 
 
Aroma:  
Fruity, sweet, and a touch spicy. Tons of cherries with honey and candi sugar. A light note of cinnamon with a hint of cloves and some baking spices. 
 
Taste:  
What is in the aroma is here. The sweet cherries and the candi sugar are more pronounced. The cinnamon and other spices are quite a bit sharper. The sip dries slightly and does not get cloying but it is certainly sweet and spicy. The alcohol is not hidden and provides a noticeable boozy note. 
 
Feel:  
Sharp but also syrupy. Warm to hot from the alcohol. The body is medium-light. 
 
Overall:  
This is not my favorite BDSA nor my favorite Troeg's offering, but this makes a decent winter warmer. If you like sweet, fruity, and boozy beers, this one is for you. 
 
My ratings reflect this beer as Holiday beer or a Winter Warmer (which is what Mad Elf really is). I would rate this much lower as the BSDA that it is currently listed as.",3.86
The Mad Elf,"I didn't like it as much as a I thought I would, but it was still pretty good.",3.89
The Mad Elf,"(Freshest by 07/15/2023); Pours an opaque reddish copper into a Samuel Smith Imperial pint glass with a thin tannish head that fizzes and dissipates quickly leaving no lacing. Malts & cherry forward in the nose with a nice sweet earthy aroma to boot. Taste follows nose with a tart velvety finish. Very slight carbonation with the spicy Belgian yeast mid tongue, a syrupy mouth and noticeable alcohol burn, but hey @ 11% ABV it's hard to hide. This has been a staple in my beer fridge around the holidays for many moons. Always enjoy kicking back with a couple of these on cold winter nights.",4.04

Smoked Porter,"From notes 4/2/12: Pours dark brown with a ruby highlight when held to the light. The pour produces a frothy, tan, short-lived head that receded to nothing and left no lacing.

Taste is the same with heavier dark malt notes and a nice nuttiness with minor hop hints in the finish and a lingering bitter aftertaste. The level of smoke is a little disappointing. The taste is well balanced. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied with nice carbonation, smooth and very drinkable.",3.92
Smoked Porter,"Not as smoke forward as I like but still an undeniably good beer. It's a bit more on the traditional porter side, with a nice hop bite, caramel sweetness and deep roasted nut aroma.

Hercules Double IPA,"Rerate, 355 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 9.1%., 85 IBU. Orange to amber colour, slightly hazy.

I’m upping it a point. Original rating: Bottle, at The Rover, Göteborg. Amber colour, hazy. Sweet and alcoholic aroma and flavour, but also plenty of hops, as expected from a ""double IPA"".

S: Hard to put a finger on what this smells like. Smells like it will taste sour. It has notes of a typical IPA, but different. 3.0 
 
T: Tastes about like it smells... kind of weird. It has a harshness that sort of overpowers the other flavors of the beverage.

Aroma lost on my Covid damaged nose.

The taste has a rich creaminess to it, at least that is what I get out of it. I also love the design of the bottles, it is a mixture of classy and cheesy that really appeals to me, however I do prefer the taste out of the can more. One of the most satisfying bottom shelf beers you’ll find, it’s Miller High Life “The Champagne of Beers!

The taste is slightly sugary, with raisin flavor before an alcohol hot, barely bitter finish. Not real complex and scary close to cherry cough syrup. The mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with below average carbonation and anundry finish. Overall, subpar.

A little bit of alcohol seeps through, but just barely. Flavor profile carries the same profile forward, hitting notes of plum, dark fruits, raisins, fig and toffee with caramely, nutty malts underneath. Alcohol is a little more apparent here. Mouth feel is full with a medium-thick consistency that firms up to 'thick' when the glass has been warmed slightly. Light graininess adds a little texture to each sip.

Titan IPA,"Had on tap at boondocks fun center Thornton 
 
On arrival there is a very light haze in a deep gold body dome lacing forms. 
 
Aroma is more of an old school WCIPA, with a touch of dank edd, and an almost toasty malt in the very back. Not as intense as expected. Slight bitter herbal hops that are almost but not quite piney. 
 
Taste follows the aroma with a decent bitterness right up front, that carries an herbal, dank, flavor that fades slightly to a mellow pine resin, and toasted malt. Super clean and crisp.  
 
The feel is super smooth, due to a dryness taming the full malty body. Finish is longer and is very balanced with a slight warming sensation. Very good 7%+ IPA in this category.

Rodenbach Grand Cru,"Poured into a tulip.  
 
Pours clear dark brown with garnet highlights. Excellent tan foamy head. Limited head. Excellent lacing.  
 
Detectable to strong acidity on the nose with dark fruit and caramel sugar notes. Perhaps some orange peel. 
 
The flavor is complex and refined. Acidic but not overpoweringly so. Excellent balance with sweeter flavors of apple, raisin, and a bit of oaking. The mature beer portion of this blend is what keeps the restraint just right. 
 
Like the flavor, the feel is well balanced. Not drying but not sticky either. Vanishing carbonation. The first few sips have a fair amount; it subsides into tart smoothness quickly. 
 
For my personal taste, this brew may be a shade sweet and tame for the style, but that's also the level of restraint the brewer was intentionally pursuing. Nailed it to say the least.",4.25

Rodenbach Grand Cru,"poured from the bottle into Belgian tulips. It's too cold for critical tasting but I didn't want wait. My wife loves sours so I've tried many over the years. 
L: muddy river water, hazy brown, not the look I'd be shooting for, but we don't drink beer with our eyes 
S: beautiful. you can smell the acid forthwith, accompanied by caramel or toffee, a box of raisins, maybe some orange peel 
T: racy acidity. Sour orange, raisins and toffee. Long sour finish. Elegant stuff compared to the kettle sours you find sometimes at brewpubs. Not as serious and complex as our best wild ales. Somewhere in between. 
F: appropriate weight. Any more malt and it would be a mess. Definitely not too thin. 
O: a fun treat - glad someone came up with this style of beer back in the dark ages. They built some beautiful gothic cathedrals too, so maybe not too dark. The acidity of this one is high and more to my wife's tastes - I think I prefer the Duchesse one, but this is still super fantastic",4.79

Rodenbach Grand Cru,"Appearance: Poured with a sliver of head that simply couldn't stick around and produced no lace. The body is a opaque cloudy brown, which barely reveals a hint of red when put up to the light, which I suppose is appropriate to style, but doesn't seem very appetizing to me for some reason. 
 
Smell: Oh dear...it's like some kind on unholy mix of wine, apple cider and malt vinegar. I think I am also catching a bit of caramel malt in the background. I will given points certainly of potency, as zero warmup needed for that to be produced. I'll also give it points for complexity, but this is an assault on my olfactory senses. This is a sour at a level that I just can't see liking.  
 
Taste: Where this beer starts, is where I'd have liked it to end. There is a potent lemon note seemingly barely curbed by some nice notes of cherry and apple, but then the beast is let loose as it passed outright into drinking vinegar with some brown sugar thrown into it, before this odd dry sand skunkness kind of creeps in over the ruins of that experience. There is identifiable complexity here, but the core sour component overshadows it. It's like an Indy band you like, touring with a band that plays with metal nails and a chalkboard. 
 
Mouthfeel: The transitioning here starts high and jumps into orbit, and is then lost to the solar winds, leaving behind acid and sand for us to contemplate. That passes to go back to just a sour lemon note in the aftertaste, which would could be present, if you didn't experience what caused it. Carbonation is also pretty much absent here. There's very little here I enjoy. 
 
Drinkability: Drinkable like a fancy lemonade, made with every bell and whistle, except you used half the water, and no sugar. Way too potent for my liking, and the acidic note I mentioned earlier seems to linger at the top of my stomach after it has gone down. At least the low carbonation doesn't further agitate things down there. 
 
Final Thoughts: I don't think I've ever had a Flanders Red Ale I truly liked, but I also don't recall one ever being this potent. I know there are people who enjoy this, and that this is their jam. There are notes there that tell me, yes this beer is a remarkably complex offering. However for me, they are buried under the sour note of this offering. This is very much not for me, and didn't even make it pass the half way mark. If you relish in sours, this might be for you but this is a hard pass for me.",2.42
Rodenbach Grand Cru,I do not like sours but this is one that got it right. Would not consider it sour but “tangy” in a way.

Clare's Thirsty Ale,"Part of the wonderful deluge of midwest goodies sent my way by @FBarber during NBS BIF #13. 
 
Gorgeous pour. Body traps light. Completely dark. Lovely finger of soft dark brown foam. Quite the beaut. 
 
Nose has lovely rich velvety espresso with vanilla and milk chocolate and sure enough there's a hint of raspberries layered in there as well. Inviting. 
 
The berries are much more prevalent here, beginning at the first sip. It starts off as just kind of a general berry/fruit sweetness that builds alongside the other components I will get to in a moment to reveal a jammy decidedly raspberry note. We'll come back to this later. The build alongside this has silky espresso and dark chocolate as well as a hint of vanilla and spice and oak from the barrel. This brings us back to the raspberry. You know how raspberries are actually kind of tart alongside their juicy sweetness? It's one of the great things about them, is they offer a balance and a range of experience, and that presents here. The finish has some bitter from the coffee, and a bit of pucker that feels like the raspberry tartness joining the oakiness of the barrels and a bit of alcohol astringency (that works well in this situation to accentuate the other flavours listed there) to give it a little 'ooh!' to the finish. Really enjoyable. 
 
Body is velvety smoothe, and that tart finish I descibe above fades to leave behind some of the dark chocolate bitterness and a slight reminder of the alcohol contained therein. Would not descibe it as hot, but it isn't shy about it's double digit ABV. 
 
I'm really enjoying this. Raspberry and chocolate are such a natural seeming pairing, but I feel like I still don't see it quite as often as I'd expect, in beer. I think it really really works well here, and am grateful to have had the opportunity to try it. Thanks Frank!",4.36

Poured nearly black, which for a winter ale was a bit surprising. Still, capped with the brown head it looked quite enticing. 
The aroma was bourbon, and that’s about it. 
The taste followed- there was some roasted malts that came through but I couldn’t find any coconut in the mix. Not sure if if it “aged out” or something, but I never found it. 
The feel was excellent for the flavors, bourbon is a sipping drink you know.

It pours a really nice dense black with scant tan head - again 5 years old...so my fault on the head. 
Amazing nose with chocolate, cinnamon spice and vanilla - perhaps a hint of roasty coffee - but the spice notes are just right. 
Taste is smooth with chocolate note, vanilla sweetness and cinnamon spice, yet maintains a bit of a roast coffee note also with a hint of bitterness. 
Despite the limited head, this maintains a brisk carbonation and a beautifully silky creamy mouthfeel. Hopefully Stone (Sapporo) sends some fresh stuff north to Canada as pretty sure this 5 year old bottle was the last time sold here....",4.37

In any event, this particular brew is black in color. It boasts a thick, lasting, tan head. The nose is muted initially; it is faintly redolent of sweetness, cream, and spice. 
 
It is creamy and medium-bodied in feel.  
 
The palate stuns me. Beautiful flavors of dark chocolate and coffee meld flawlessly with a variety of spices. The spice component is perfect; it is not overdone.

Saison Bernice,"Poured from a capped 750mL bottle into my Troubadour tulip.  
 
Nearly clear Arylide yellow body with a steady stream of micro-bubbles. Off white cap disappears rapidly. Almost no lacing, nor legs.  
 
Subtle complex yeast-driven aromatics suffused with poolish, fresh cut hay, and stone fruit. Floral, with a whisper of white wine/champagne.  
 
Bright with a balance of light grain/malt, tart meyer lemon/unripe pear, and a faint peppery/barnyard edge from the Brett. Light clean bitterness with a touch of alfalfa and clover. Long, medium-dry finish reveals full maturation and synergy of ingredients.  
 
A bit thin and fizzy with lingering acidity. What meager roundness is present seems almost (but not quite) chalky.  
 
Excellent aroma and flavor, a core expression from the brewery, but the body is more like a lambic than a saison - perhaps this was not a great bottle/batch, but at the price point I'm not eager to roll the dice again right away.",4.21

The malt base is beautifully smooth, but the hops come through kinda muddied because of that spicy earthy herbal presence which, given that it's prominently mentioned in the description, is definitely intentional.

Near black body with a thin, semi-durable beige head. A thin dark reddish-brown edge is visible with back lighting. This smells quite sweet, I assume from the bourbon and maple syrup. It has a lightly sweet taste with a laudably balanced mix of chocolate, bourbon, and coffee. Not surprisingly, maple syrup notes are faint. Relatively thick and very smooth body. Well hidden ABV.

The aroma was strong, so strong even my Covid affected nose caught a wiff of the chocolate and bourbon. 
The taste was very well balanced for so much chocolate, and rich chocolate at that. It was the star of the show but the supporting cast of coffee and dark fruits and bourbon were not lost but very present. 
The feel is darned near ideal for the genre, just a tiny bit less “chewy” or viscous than expected.

A vigorous pour produces a dark brown liquid churning up a small finger of tan foam. It settles very quickly to a ring around the glass. The smell is dominated by what else? Mackinac fudge.

A bit ashy tasting in the finish but nothing that detracts from the experience. The feel is medium bodied, rich and smooth.

No. Is this beer comparable to beers that were crafted for taste? No. This beer was crafted for affordability. It doesn't even taste bad.

The beer pours a golden amber color with a frothy white head and light lacing. The frothy head dissipated pretty quickly and head retention was fair at best. So this isn't a very impressive looking beer. On the nose things didn't get much better, as I picked up sweet canned corn and maybe some light cereal grains. The flavor profile was just more of the same in this lightweight beer, with the sweet corn flavor dominating. The beer is pretty watery, with at most some light bitterness on the finish.

333 Premium Export Beer,"330ml pull-tab can from a minimart in Hanoi. Cost was below $0.50 USD. 5.30% ABV. Brief impressions below: 
 
Has an odd adjuncty sweetness to it, bending it towards syrupy. Definitely artificial in terms of flavour. Cheap malt syrup, metallic off-flavour, pils/pale malts. No noticeable hop character. 
 
Overcarbonated. Smooth, wet, unrefreshing, medium-bodied (where it ought to be light-bodied). 
 
Drinkable as a budget brew when it's cold. Most Vietnamese canned beers seem to blend together with few distinctive characteristics, but this is recognizably a notch below the norm. 
 
High D+ (2.50) / NOT RECOMMENDED 
 
*** 
July 11th, 2016: 2nd can purchased in Hoi An. Sabeco owns Bia Saigon, apparently. 
 
The abnormally slender hole left by the pull-tab once opened allows less beer through than most cans, which is something of a Godsend seeing how ghastly this is. 
 
Sweet malt syrup, adjunct (corn, rice, who cares?), stale barley. Too sweet, too simple, and certainly shallow. There's no intricacy or depth of flavour here at all, and nothing really to come for save for the 5.30% ABV (which I'll grant is above average for regional lagers, and isn't badly disguised). 
 
Not a beer I intend to revisit unless economy demands it, even at its reasonable-by-Western-standards price. Drinkable enough, to be fair. We've all had worse, but it's still pretty poor fare.

San Miguel Especial,"Spanish brewed version...likely better than the UK one. 
 
Rather large bubbles. Looks refreshing. Aroma of dry malt and some faint hops. I like the bitterness in the aroma.  
 
The malt is far more flavorsome than the majority of pilsners, as is common in Spain. Mahou is far superior, but I much prefer this to Estrella, which for me is mega over-rated. When I was younger I stayed in a holiday resort in Ibiza where all alcohol was free, and this was the only beer on tap. There were water jugs at our tables, so I emptied the water out and walked to where the San Miguel tap was. I saw another person with a water jug full of San Miguel, and smiled at him and said ""English"". He smiled back and said yes ; ) 
 
So for about 2 weeks, I substituted water for this. It's dry, reasonably complex, and as long as you drink the Spanish verion and not a dodgy sub licence one, which exist in multiple countries, it's pretty good. The hops add a dryness with not much flavour, however because the malt is flavoursome, almost as flavoursome as Belgian malt, the beer tastes pretty good. Unlike some other dry pilsners such as Croatian Pan and Romanian Ursus, which literally have no taste beyond the dryness. 
 
I didn't used to like this, but because of my current location I have had so many terrible beers recently, I quite like this. Mouth feel is impressive for a pilsner. Pretty good overall, I like. UK version is terrible though, as are some of the other internationally brewed ones. From memory, some don't even say where they are brewed ; )",3.05

Shocking stuff & awful tasting throughout, the nose definitely wasn't as bad & came through very slightly better than expected but still wasn't exactly great but the taste was beyond bad.

Mega strength beer, and excessively so. I actually think it's not too bad, better than some Belgian tripels. A tall slim glass keeps the head, and served chilled takes a bit of the harshness away from it. It has a citrus aspect for me, and given the strength is remarkably smooth to drink. Don't be put off, definitely worth a purchase if available. 
A couple of these and you'd be safe sleeping under a bush in the park on a cold night.....thus saving yourself a taxi fare to boot, which can be added to the coffers for sampling a few more brews. Every cloud and all that!  
 
I came back to re-review this one after a second sampling, and down graded it a touch. It is still way way better than the reviews on here, and I think labelling it as a euro strong lager somehow assumes it will be naff right from the get go! But there is the anti-snob in me.",3.68

Appearance - The beer pours a clear straw color with a small head of white foam. The head fades fast, leaving a tiny bit of lace on the sides of the glass. 
Smell - The aroma is strongest of a caramel smell mixed with a touch of bread and hay. There is a tiny bit of grain and bay on there as well. 
Taste - The taste begins with a sweet corn syrup and caramel taste with a little bit of bread and cracker. Toward the end of the taste, some light herb and hay come to the tongue. 
Mouthfeel - The body of the brew is light with a carbonation level that is average. For the style the feel is good and makes for an easy drinker.

Presidente Light,"I would like to point out that it is against site policy to call out other raters in a negative fashion. By the same token, I would like to give my eternal thanks to my local, in-person trader, @tone77 for his massive recent drop-off that included this beer! I was astounded by how much beer he brought for me & shamed by the fact that mine was merely a paltry offering. 8=( I must atone to @tone77 ! 
 
From the Bottle (his drop-off, his call): ""Presidente Light Pilsener Style Beer"". 
 
As I was prising the cap off of the Bottle for an eventual Pop!, I noticed a number of carbonation bubbles beginning to appear. Good! I like a well-carbonated beer. My follow-up slow, gentle C-Line pour still resulted in the formation of two-plus fingers of foamy. soapy, rocky, bone-white head with very good retention. Color was Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 - 5) with NE-quality clarity, just deep enough to entice The Gelt Gang of Mammon, Croesus & Midas to drop in for a taste. Nose had a pronounced cereal-like graininess, but not much in the way of either hops or unwanted adjuncts. Hmm. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium, on the big side for a Lager. The taste was sweet, mildly of perhaps (?) corn, but the fact that it was nearly unidentifiable was a bonus. It was a little too sweet & malty for my taste, but certainly well within specs for this style. I was rather impressed that it came across so well, coming from a green glass (!) bottle. Finish was semi-sweet, bordering on semi-dry. Again. more sweet than I would have liked, but not bad overall. As far as a steady diet of it might be concerned, I could see tiring of it fairly quickly. YMMV.",3.63

There was a bar everywhere. Every pool had a bar. There were three bars on the beach. Every restaurant had a bar. The main building had three different bars. When we checked it there was a bar right there at the check in, and at every bar the only beer they had was El Presidente and El Presidente Light.

It's a beer I gave a try or two already, and won't buy the six-pack, assuming it's exist. A cheap buzz if you are around these parts. For the same brewery though, I suggest Goudale instead.",2.62

Coors Banquet,"Drank a lot of this in college in Wyoming many moons ago but have not had one in at least 25 years. A 6 was $2.39 back then, so yes, ancient times. Grabbed one tonight. 
 
Looks good, but loses a little for poor foam retention.  
 
Smell is clean and light. Sweet malt, a little fresh mown hay and a faint earthy/floral hop presence (so faint I may be imagining it) 
 
Taste is light all around, but malt is a little firmer than most AAL's. Bitterness balances the other light flavors. Very light floral hops that balance well with the malt. 
 
Feel is a bit more substantial than its competitors without being out of style. Satisfying. Could do with a little less carbonation; belching as I write this, though some may consider that a positive. 
 
Overall, very good for what it is. A cut above most similar beers. Back in the day, Coors was looked down upon in CO and nearby states.

Carling Lager,"Completely solid Canadian style adjunct. I've written about this in the past, and I think that Canadian adjuncts should be considered the own sub-category, although I'm far too illiterate to explain what exactly that would entail. I do know, however, that the majority of Canadian adjuncts I've had that aren't sold stateside (Molson Export, Labatt 50, etc) have a richer flavor and creamier body than most American adjuncts, with even loss hop presence than their American counterparts and a warmer embrace of cereal nodes. 
 
This is a good example of the style, though not as good as Labatt 50 or Molson Ex. Firm cereal start, crisp and lightly sour middle, light finish with a creamy body throughout.  
 
I don't know where this falls into the (sub/super)-Premium tier of the Ontario beer market, or if such a tiering system even exists outside of the US, but I'd say this would compete well against the Pabst/Bud/Coors segment of the American market.

Well, it seems a tad lesser quality than even back then.  
Very light yellow, small short lasting head, very light corn and barley taste. Don't blink, you'll miss the hops! 
In a nutshell, not a very good beer, even at it's inexpensive price of about 17 bucks a 30 pack!

Coors Banquet,"Pushing 18 years on this site and I’ve never reviewed this beer before, let alone ever had one. I’m in Colorado now and this May as well be the official beer from here as it’s pure Rockies, down to that whole mountain water thing… 
 
Golden, just like it’s origin, as it was straw in hue, bubbly enough, and left enough lacing behind to stay on par with the foam that never fully dissipated from the surface. Adjunct, corn, and cream were in the nose as the taste was equally sweet, filling, and quasi-artificial. Plenty clear and crisp from the water, this was plenty old-school and Colorado - down to the 1936 stubby bottle that this was served in. 
 
Enough carbonation was in this to keep it lively as this oddly reminded me of Genesee Cream Ale. That was a staple of yesteryear back east as this would fit that bill had I grown up in these parts. No, this won’t win any awards but it’s worthy enough to have “Banquet” on the label as it’s a true original. Worth a go once for anyone looking to have a true All-American beer!",3.05

Aroma: Steeped cereal grains, wafts of floral hops, straw, baking biscuits, and soda crackers 
Taste: Starts off with cereal grains and crackers, closely followed by light and subtle floral hop notes that mix in well. Some straw and biscuit appear throughout and closes as it started 
Mouthfeel: Light but not too watery, clean, medium-high carbonation, and crisp and clean on the finish 
Overall: In case you’ve been living under a rock in beer land and never had Coors Original before, it’s an AAL that does what it is supposed to do – refresh, quench, and not bring too many ‘flavors’ to the table. This does just that and isn’t bad in a sea of AALs that contains plenty of awful ones",3.34

Coors Banquet,"My two favorite California IPAs bit the dust this year so it's time for me to go back to good old Coors Banquet, still my favorite of the American mega brewery lagers. Here in the Western USA Coors Banquet was one of the staple beers of the twentieth century. Every grocery store, quickie mart and gas station has it. The taste hasn't changed a bit during the decades that I have known it. Banquet is still brewed only at the Golden, Colorado brewery. 
The only question for me was ""Should I buy cans or the 1936 stubby bottles?"" I taste tested comparing bottles with a ""best by"" date three months into the future side by side with cans dated four months into future. Both containers had the same two-day stay in the refrigerator so they would have equal temperatures (36° F). The Coors Banquet in the 1936 stubby bottle was the decisive winner. No question about it. From the bottle I could smell distinct spiciness of hops which was barely noticeable from the can. Carbonation bite on the tongue was lively with the bottled brew and a bit dull from the canned. Finally, the malt was more full and sweet from the bottle. Glass makes a big difference whether it's IPA or American Adjunct Lager.

Pours a golden straw topped with an ample thick white foam; slowly receding retention leaves layers of splotchy lacing and a fading cap and collar. 
 
Aromas show muddled grainy notes and some fresh straw with a minor corn sweetness almost overshadowed entirely by an oncoming presence of grassy hops; bouquet has a quiet pop to it. 
 
Taste lots of grain and a light honeyed sweetness throughout the profile, while grassy hops come in late to give a rounded quality; finishes quickly with hints of a somewhat unpleasant metallic tone lingering. 
 
Mouthfeel holds a light body that holds nicely until the back end, where it becomes a bit watery; smooth carbonation with a progressive prickle on the palate and a decent crispness overall; finish thins and fades quickly. 
 
Solid, essentially inoffensive AAL with a developing grain character and reinforcing hoppy prickle; somewhat inconsistent overall to be a go-to, but I'd have no problem returning to this one if the situation called for it.",2.86

The mouthfeel is thin, watery, and that is to be expected for a N/A beer in my opinion. 
 
There is a sort of nutmeggy barley grain taste and slightly sweet. Clean, crisp finish. It's a N/A beer I could have more than once if I am trying to avoid alcohol.",3

Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,"Good news is, this isn't as bitter as other N.A.s out there, but this also means not as much flavour. During the summertime, I can see how this would be a light, refreshing treat. For the other seasons though, I may opt for a heartier cooked brew.",2.57
Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,"had next to the new heineken zero alcohol and the coors non alcoholic, and this was better than the coors and much worse than the heineken, more malty and sweet at the end, but unlike the coors, its a reasonable facsimile to real beer if i let it be. i never drink this kind of thing, but i think this one is better than many, it has actual flavor at resembles beer, and that alone makes it decent in its field. clear and yellowish and thin, but it holds its head really well, and looks enough like a light lager. some corny sweetness to it, even an appreciable yeast aspect, its a shame they missed out on any hops, because that seems like the easiest of the core ingredients to assimilate into a non alcoholic brew, it should at least have a balancing element, because without it, the beer finishes sugary and one dimensional, seems like a missed opportunity to me. very light body even with the sweetness, a sort of stale and metallic layer too though, high carbonation saves it for me. i would choose this over many of its peers, but now that they have the new heineken alcohol free beer, this one may take a hit...",2.65
Amnesia IPA,"Pours copper amber clear with nice frothy foamy cap that quickly fades. Notes of metallic hops and pine. Sharp piney ipa with bitter hoppy after taste. Not for the non-ipa or craft snobs. An okay at best micro from Indian Wells with a 7.2% ABV punch (which is not written on the bottle). Not good, could not finish - first time I have EVER dumped most of my beer down the drain. 
 
 
Update: received the Triple IPA version as a gift. The 1pint 6 oz bottle tasted MUCH better than their standard 7.2% standard IPA which tasted metallic and may have been skunked. The triple 
has a huge Hop forward 99 IBU and big bite at 9.9% ABV. Okay local CA micro triple IPA. (TIPA?). Cheers to bold hoppy micro brews.",2.79

Amnesia IPA,"Comes in a mixture of yellow and orange with about a 2/3"" head. Aroma didn't drop hops, instead dropped an almost fusel amount of alcohol.

Amnesia IPA,,2.5
Amnesia IPA,"Appearance: Moderately hazy amber body, with a modest, fine-beaded white head, which soon collapses to a dusting of white foam. Modest agitation, say by gently tipping the glass, produces a surge of foam at the glass walls. The lacing is fine, and glass-coating. 
 
Aroma: Dark bread notes and malt dominate the aroma, the hop presence is only slightly notable, and has an herbal quality. In all, the aroma seems quite understated for the style. 
 
Taste: The taste begins with dark, bready malts, as the aroma would suggest. As the taste progresses, there is a moderate herbal hop presence, with a level of restraint that I would expect to find in a pale ale. Later in the taste, there are some citric hops. Finishes with a mild herbal bitterness. 
 
Mouth feel: Soft, but a bit thin, with very mild carbonation. 
 
Drinkability/notes: An lackluster example of the style. 
 
Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice.",1.87

Amnesia IPA,I actually stopped at this brewery on my way home from Mammoth. When you walk in you get more of a factory operation feeling than a beer loving microbrewery feeling. They seem to have more than half of their store dedicated to soda. They did have tastings and their flagship beer aged in oak barrels seemed like a waste of oak barrels. Getting to the beer...I'm not going to say it's the worst beer I've had but it's not far from it. I would not purchase this beer again unless it was around the price of Natty ice. It has a clean taste yet lacks the signature taste you get from certain IPA's. The carbonation is weird too...almost as if they gave it extra carbonation or something from their soda machines. For $7.99+ for a six pack your money will be better spend on something like Sierra Nevada.,1.25

Michelob Golden Draft,,2.34
Michelob Golden Draft,"Drank from a 12 ounce can. Scores are based on the style. 
 
Look - Would much prefer if the can was full blue or full silver, the gradient isn't doing it for me. That said, the circular seal is nice, and the emphasis on ""Golden"" draws in the eyes. The Minnesota shaped barcode is a neat touch too. 
 
Smell - I can't quite describe the experience of this beer hitting my nose. The smell gets you from a good distance away, but it's the smell of nearly nothing. It's like a diamond plate floor covered in sticky beer residue. Very metallic and mildly sweet. 
 
Taste - Thankfully, the taste is much more interesting than the smell. It's a comforting flavor too. Even though I've never had this beer before, it tastes like tailgating, like being in a trailer at the racetrack, like going to a concert at the county fair. This tastes like public gatherings. Or more realistically, it's a fine balance of malty and earthy. Not too sweet, not too bitter. An exemplary AAL. 
 
Feel - This beer feels perfectly matched to its taste. Medium-thin body with just enough back-of-tongue sparkle to it. 
 
Overall - I definitely prefer this to the light version, but the light version is probably objectively better for a full day of parking lot drinking. However, at home, I'm much more comfortable with the full weight. It's tasty, it's easy, it's relaxing, and I can confidently say that I like it.",3.57

This is like Corona that comes with lime already in it, except it's an interpretation by Labatt. It has a nice scent to it. 
 
The lime flavoring tastes a bit artificial but I'm guessing they just put the type of lime juice you'd find at the store that comes in the green plastic lime bottle intinto it.

S: good bit of lime aroma dominating its scent, almost smells real; really smells more like Sprite with a lil (corn-fed) beer mixed in... smells alright for what it smells like, a shandy 
 
T: not gonna lie, a relatively delightful flavor at first: lime-infused, lightly-doughy malt base; clean and dry on the outflow, though the finish has the faintest color to it like a mix between a lime sweet-tart candy / lime air freshener... humming aftertaste of lime and cereal, like Trix; dry, doughy 
 
F: very soft suds, pillowy texture and flow, disappearing finish... maybe a delicate touch of residual lime syrup slickness? who knows?... light and easy-drinking, even when drinking at cellar temp 
 
O: tried it just to try it once... it wasn't too too dissimilar to a Mexican beer with actual limes shoved in the bottle (minus real citrus acidity); kind of surprising and thankful it didn't taste more glaringly artificial... maybe this is what light beers need - flavor infusion - so what...

But I must say, this beer did its job: refreshing after 90 minute flight delays in Chicago and a bumpy bus ride from Calgary airport into the Rockies. 
 
More important than my review is my remark that I find it funny the brewer calls this an IPA (I presume in the British tradition since Nova Scotia is close geographically and spiritually) and BA has 697 reviews with American Blonde styling. It also should be noted that UnTappd averages this as a 3 rating and BA's average is 2.63. Something screwy going on here since I find BA usually .25 above UnTappd's average.

Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,"People don't understand that this is not the English IPA first brewed by Alexander Keith, in Halifax back in 1820 (the first IPA brewed in North America). Until Anheuser-Busch got their claws into it, this was a heavily-hopped, all malt (no corn) mash IPA. Now, it is a weak-flavoured, lightly-hopped, 5% ABV Blonde lager, which meets none of the criteria for an IPA. This is not the beer I drank at university, not even a pale (forgive the pun) imitation. It is thin, light, with no lacing, and a taste typical of Anheuser-Busch swill. Might as well be drinking Bud Light (but no one really drinks that, it's just an urban legend, just like the notion that there are people who actually drink Moxie). This was my go-to beer back many decades ago, but now, I wouldn't touch it.",2.34

Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,"Tried 3 ways. Standard pour into a standard pint glass (followed by same poured into Sam Adams IPA glass trying to capture more aroma though the former is obviously the most common serving method) and also from the can.  
 
Pours a crystal clear yellow gold color with moderate large bubble carbonation. Initial frothy head reduces quickly to poor lacing and little rim retention. Adhesion on the glass is poor.  
 
Smells of wet grass, hay, corn, corn syrup, and that paste you ate back in Kindergarten (although you won't admit it). Very poor though in carrying with the malt liquor and adjunct lager corn based beer category. 
 
All three palette notes are the same--- lots of paste, envelope glue, candy corn, corn syrup, stale uncooked rice, and a bit of wet hay. Very poor if only average at best again considering the category.  
 
Syrup like mouthfeel with not so clean finish. Lingering corn, paste, and a bit of skunk cabbage that I honestly wish was more. At least it would be less bland and less like I just revisited my love of paste during art class/non-savory snack time. 
 
Poor if not below average at best overall. Not recommended. So many other good NAs out there... maybe if you want to drink a piece of history... as well as feel like you are... but beyond that checkbox move along young man/lady to something better.

Look - Very busy but kind of charming. It has a sort of simple 90s aesthetic to it. It's not the most beer-looking, but I like it. 
 
Smell - Sweet and malty, very powerful smell for an adjunct lager. Smells more like a German dunkel almost. A good smell but on the verge of overpowering. 
 
Taste - The taste more or less follows the smell. Very sweet, very bready, somewhat of a caramel taste. Could use with some more bitterness to tone it down, but it's got a character that I've never experienced in this style. 
 
Feel - A weird creamy/soapy texture. Not entirely pleasant. Could definitely use with a bit more carbonation.

Taste normal for an adjunct lager but there is a bad lingering bitter after taste that is not hop driven. Mouthfeel is poor with sharp carbonation and a burning sensation to the tongue. After swallowing, there is a thick persistent oily/soapy feeling that doesn't go away. Overall, this beer is flawed at the basics.

Smells of cheerios, or other breakfast cereal, cut bananas, and malty grain. Actually an excellent nose.  
 
HOLY SWEETNESS BATMAN. It's like someone dumped sugar in my beer. The banana runt flavor is there, which I like, but then it turns cloyingly bad with lumps of sugar and malt mix. A pine stab very faintly finishes out the profile, but it barely pushes through the overwhelming sweetness in this beer. Notes of banana linger through the end.  
 
Creamy yet still carbonated, but nothing exceptional. A little sticky in a bad way. Ends wet.

Brew pours a deep-golden yellow in color with a good 1-finger foamy/creamy head. Decent amount of lacing is seen when sipped. Aroma is of sweet grain for the most part. Pretty much is said for the taste with LOTS of sweetness I am guessing from the grain they used. Too much actually. Funny that several times on the can they mention: ""Craft Brewed in Small Batches"" with a website with the three ""W's"" followed by ""DamnGoodBeer"" dot com. Well...OK then. LOL!

The feel is slick with solvent alcohol. It does have a certain crispness to it though. 
 
For $3 a six-pack, I figured that I would try it. It's worth spending just a little more for Miller High Life, in my opinion. This reminds me of a cheap malt liquor light.

Pours crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a small fairly dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a minimal spotty lace cap that linger. Light spotty lacing on the, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lightly tart lime juice, citrus peel/zest, cracker, corn, white bread, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of limes, pale malt/grains, and light earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of lightly tart lime juice, citrus peel/zest, cracker, corn, white bread, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Mild herbal, floral, grassy, zesty bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of lightly tart lime juice, citrus peel/zest, cracker, corn, white bread, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and balance of limes, pale malt/grains, and light earthy hop flavors; with a solid malt/bitterness balance, and no cloying flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with no yeasty notes present. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4%. Overall this is a nice fruited light lager. All around nice robustness and balance of limes, pale malt/grains, and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink. Very flavorful and not too watery for the ABV. Great balance between vibrant limes and pils malt/grains; with solid earthy hop presence for the style. Not overdone on adjuncts. A nicely enjoyable offering, and great style example. Would be great for summer.",3.65
Labatt Blue Light Lime,Not bad. Didn’t find the lime flavor overpowering. Tasted more at the end of each sip than at the beginning. Refreshing beer for a hot summer day. Very watery mouthfeel so it goes right down. Might have it again sometime. Update : I did have it again.Cheers.,5
Labatt Blue Light Lime,"Well, it looks like even Canadian brewers are jumping on the fad that is light lagers with lime flavoring. I went into this review knowing full well that this wasn't going to be a high quality beer that I'd be reviewing, but a part of me wanted to know how it would stack up against Bud Light Lime and its ilk. Why? Who knows, but that's just the way my mind works. 
 
Labatt Light Lime pours a yellow/gold color. A fizzy, sudsy head (less than a pinky's worth) forms and thins out in a little under 30 seconds. There was quite a collection of fizzy ""soda"" bubbles on the side of the glass. The aroma was of sweet citrus and lime, with some light grain and vegetable smell. As mentioned, the beer is indeed fizzy, and overall feels pretty thin on the palette. The light citric/lime flavor is the most dominant note here, but the beer is still pretty watery even with that lime presence. There are some grain and vegetable flavors detectable behind the lime, but that's about it. The aftertaste is clean and almost non existant except for some non-descript dryness, and there is no alcoholic warmth at all in this beer. 
 
Indeed, not a high quality beer at all. It is easy to drink, but I would say this is more lime than beer. Save for a summer day thirst quencher when you need something to whet your whistle and nothing more.",1.98
Labatt Blue Light Lime,"This is up there with the absolute worst beers I've ever had. 
 
It pours like you'd expect, clear and gold, with a quickly dissipating head. 
 
This smells so unbelievably artificial, like syrupy and saccharine lime, with corn syrup and skunk. 
 
This honestly tastes terrible. It's revolting, with an overly artificial and unpleasant lime flavor, just out whatever the base light lager tastes like. I get some sweet corn and syrupyness This isn't even all that crisp, which is what the style is supposed to be. 
 
This is just sad. There's no reason at all to drink this.",1.26

Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,"Comparing only NA beers, BUD Light and Miller Lite, not my favorite Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.: 
[b]Only available in cans in my area.[/b] This poured with a very light straw yellow color 
It produced a three finger head and still had a full head an hour later. 
The aroma was definitely that of a decent beer! 
The taste was that of a very light, but fairly full bodied light beer with no burnt or overtly sweet aftertastes. 
I was not expecting much because Old Milwaukee has been in and out of production, but for a non alcoholic beer, this is one American NA beer I would serve to my guests along with Clausthaler and Becks, the best of the bunch!!",3.85

Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,"A: Pours a crystal clear medium straw yellow in color with moderate amounts of active visible carbonation rising quickly from the bottom of the glass and some faint golden yellow highlights. The beer has a three finger tall sudsy bright white head that reduces to a large patch of medium thick film surrounded by a very thin film covering the remainder of the surface of the beer and a thin ring at the edges of the glass. Significant amounts of lacing are observed. 
 
S: Moderate aromas of corn adjuncts over lighter aromas of grainy malts. 
 
T: Upfront there are light flavors of grainy malts with light to moderate flavors of corn adjuncts, slightly vegetal. Minimal amounts of sweetness or hop presence. Overall the beer has a very light flavor more reminiscent of mineral water than a beer. 
 
M: Light bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Slightly thin/watery.

Labatt Blue Light Lime,"Labatt Blue Light Lime brewed Labatt Brewing Company Ltd., with an ABV of 4.00% This brew pours out a nice golden, amber color with a smell white head. The head to this brew goes away fast. This brew has the look of most light lagers on the market, not saying that is a bad thing. The smell of Labatt Blue Light Lime is sweet with lime grains and malts. Labatt Blue Light Lime smell puts you in the mind set of lemon lime soda. Now for the taste , it is Lime, with some beer taste. This brew has a nice smooth lime taste to it. Not much else to say. The mouthfeel of Labatt Blue Light Lime, is Light , Smooth, clean and refreshing. This is a nice smooth brew to drink on a hot day. There is nothing overpowering about this brew. Overall I'm giving Labatt Blue Light Lime a 3 out of 5. Labatt Brewing Company Ltd.,did a nice job with this one. I would buy this brew again when it get really hot.",3.06

Landshark Lager,"12oz undated bottle, unless there's a date on the 6-er, I might get back to you on that. 
 
On the pour, there was some decent, white head, that maxed out at 2 fingers, although it faded fast. Surprisingly, above average lacing is left on the sides of my glass. Body is golden and light. 
 
Aroma is like an exaggerated corona with skunky hops right upfront, and a dry, but lightly corny malt in the back. 
 
Taste is like a watered down, and extra sweet killer high life, with some of those ""corona style"" skunky hops. This beer is very sweet, and rhe finish tastes like corn flakes. For the high price it just isn't good. 
 
Feel is filling and syrupy. Why does this come off as so sugary? The aroma did not imply it was going to be this full and lingering in the finish. This is closer to heineken than corona, and I mean that in a negative way.  
 
Overall this was pretty disappointing. Not as bad as some true cheapo lagers, but the whole selling point of this beer is Jimmy Buffet, and honestly the brew is just as whitewashed and deluded as calling Jimmy Buffet authentic Yucutan music.",2.63

Warsteiner Premium Fresh,"Beer pours a pale, translucent gold, capped by two fingers of loose foam that persists for longer than expected but does ultimately recede to a thin layer and then some islands. A bit of lacing, and a lot of visible carbonation. 
 
Smell is bready, biscuity malt, light cracker. Faint sourness, slightly grassy hops, bitter greens. A touch metallic. 
 
Taste is slightly sour malt, biscuit. Faint hop bitterness, more bitter salad greens, slight metallic twang. Carbonation is high, and the body is quite watery. But at least there is some hop presence here? 
 
I've had worse. It doesn't compete with Krombacher--which I would consider the standard-bearer of NA beers--but it's recognizably beery and not outright offensive.

Cara Pils,"I drank a can of this beer at a friend's place, he hated them, but didn't want to throw them away. It is a beer generally drunk by homeless people on the street, to give you an idea. It looks like a regualr pils beer, although much lighter. It has a very unfresh smell, and the flavor is awful. Can't really put my finge rto what it is eaxctly, but I never tatsed something like that before. The beer also leaves a very penetrating flavor and felling in the mouth Definitely the worst beer I ever drank.",1.3
Cara Pils,"Cara Pils is generally drank because it is the cheapest beer available in the Belgian market. Thus is carries a bit of a stigma in Belgium. People drink this for the sale purpose of getting drunk as cheaply as possible when they have absolutely no money. It is crap but it is ridiculously cheap. I mean, really, really cheap, buying an equal amount of water at the supermarket costs more money than this beer.  
 
Second note, I believe that Piedboeuf doesn’t brew this. No one actually brews Cara Pils, they just buy this stuff from whatever brewery makes it the cheapest. Sometimes contracts change, I have heard that they put failed batches from several pils brewers into this stuff, probably including stuff from Piedboeuf. The French brewery Champigneulles (TCB Beverages) who specializes in this kinds of beers most likely makes most of this stuff, these days. 
 
Review: Bright, clear, golden, urine-coloured with little brief white head. Musty, wet corn in the nose, hay, dirty water, rotting lemon,… Watery, corn wet and dusty, rotting hay, light rotting, touch metallic, rotting lemon, expired medication, unnerving bitterness,… bitter disgusting aftertaste.

But compared to world famous 'beers' like Heineken, it can still hold its own. 
On any given summer sunday I prefer an ice cold Cara over most popular pilseners. 
 
Sure, the taste is not great, it tastes somewhere in between foul and average, but at the bargain price of 0,26€/33cl, this is to be expected. Bad image aside, this is just a regular pilsener, which would be much better liked if it was branded better.",2.52

Malty and fruity aroma with some alcoholic notes, but not unpleasant. Hints of oak and leather. Flavour is very sweet, but surprisingly it is not as repulsive as many other (often less sweet) golden strong lagers. Tolerable hops obviously contribute to a (nearly) acceptable balance.

Bavaria 8.6 Original,"The local bottle shop near me stock some of these strong European lagers, which are good on a Friday night, when you want to get your buzz on, and not think too hard about the present, future, or past. They've started stocking this one, so thought I'd pick up a can and give it a go.  
 
Look: Clear, very bubbly golden beer, looking like a classic Australian adjunct lager, rather than a typical pale Euro lager. Frothy white head that has more important places to be than my glass by the way it's disappearing as I type this.  
 
Smell: Strong alcohol whiff on the nose, bitter grassy hops, somewhat sour on the nose, biscuit malt. Smells like a hangover in the making.  
 
Taste: Sweet syrupy goo. It's like they've poured a lot of simple syrup and mixed it with straight alcohol. Struggling to find anything positive about the flavour, might be some hop extract in there somewhere, but if it is they've mixed with with simple syrup and turned it into a hop cordial.  
 
Feel: Smooth, not overly carbonated, but sickly sweet.  
 
Overall: 20th review, and this is the first one I'm proper regretting. I've had OJ strong, and from memory that's more palatable, this is just beer cordial. I look on the can and sure enough, it lists hop extract, and glucose syrup. 1-2 cans may get you buzzed, but heck, I'd rather drink a 6 pack of an average Aussie adjunct lager than force myself to down this. Better drink it ice cold, because once it warms up, it's going to be completely undrinkable.

Stroh's,"Poured out of a 12 oz can into one of my pint glasses, this beer pours a clear, pale medium golden color with lots of little bubbles fairly rapidly and continually rising to the beer's surface. Has a fluffy looking white head that's initially well over an inch thick when first served. After a few minutes, it settles to a thick ring lining the inside of the glass along with some nice cluster swirls of film layer surface foam. Good lacing here too. Not a bad look at all. Aromas of some bready malts some herbal and floral notes that I assume are the hop aroma. The taste is pretty much the same, w/ some bready malts followed by floral, maybe some slight hints of corn and or rice, and herbal notes w/ slight hop bitterness. No bad tasting adjunct off-flavors or awful metallic off-flavors here. The flavor, while not great or even that prevalent by any means, seems to suit this beer just fine for what it is. Certainly one of the better tasting beers of this style that I've had. It doesn't even start tasting terrible as it warms up a bit. Has a crisp, yet smooth, light bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Easy to drink in the way a beer of this style should be. Has a clean finish and decent aftertaste. Not too shabby, but not great to me either. This beer is exactly what it is trying to be. Refreshing on a warm summer night here in Cleveland, OH.

Bland and ""dusty"" flavour, fairly dry and thus kind of refreshing when ice cold, but the bitterness is very low, and there are hardly any flavour elements worth mentioning. Utterly forgettable.

F - Medium-light body with nitro-like carbonation. Refreshing. Wet. Crisp. 
O - This beer's flavor HAS to be an acquired taste. Not for the reason I see many people drinking it (I don't), but because it doesn't taste bad, but for the reason that I'm not familiar with the flavors present.

Yanjing Beer,"I had this beer in China and it was my personal favourite. Liked it better than the other Chinese beers. Easy drinking and nice and strong. It's typically drunk when you're eating spicy Asian food. The general reason is that it helps to clear the palate in a refreshing hydrating way so you can move on to the next spicy dish.

Yanjing Beer,"Let’s be real: the beer is what it is. I’m not going to call it a Chinese Heineken, but it still isn’t gonna win me over like Kiera Knighlty in a nightie.

Yanjing Beer,"Decanted from an 11.2 oz (330 ml) bottle into a custom taster pint; no production information. 
A: Pours a crystal clear, straw to golden color with a two finger, foamy white head, decent retention, but spotty lacing at first, although it picks up lower on the glass. 
S: Peppery and toasty with grainy (especially corn) and grassy aromas. 
T: Semidry. Fruity (apple and corn) and very lightly malty with a surprising degree of bitterness given the style and area of origination. 
M: Light bodied with very solid carbonation. Drinks smoothly, crisply, and cleanly. 
O: This is a solidly constructed lager without being stand out. It is no longer in the clear bottle, as depicted above, but rather in a green one (which is no improvement from the perspective of skunking. The absence of a production date is a problem, especially as it is an import and trying hard to penetrate the American market.",3.44

The taste is grainy malt, with a touch of sour, a tiny bit of grassy hops ending with a mildly bitter (barely vegetable) finish.

Flavor is full of flaws, I mean wow, I haven't had an unclean beer like this in awhile. Corn flakes doused in bleach, followed by oysters, saltines, and wet leaves.  
 
Feel is crisp but not clean, rather starchy on the palate, with some actual alcohol heat for 5.5%.  
 
Overall, ""ice"" beers are a joke, but I was really surprised that at 5.5% this beer made absolutely no effort to disguise its alcohol content. This is a truly horribly made beer, and I'm being completely objective. A warming furnace to your throat and stomach at a measly 5.5% ABV.",1.96
Genesee Ice Beer,"L: Pours typical golden amber color with a reasonably large head and some lacing.  
 
S: Corn, malt, cracker and slight grassy hops. 
 
T: Tastes way too alcoholic for the ABV. The only ice beer with noticable fusel alcohol, tastes worse than Steel Reserve with slightly less burn. Other than that, it does taste like corn and more malt than some beers. Doesn't taste anything like regular Genesee Beer, the cream ale, or even its high gravity cousin, Genesee Black. 
 
F: Goes down smooth, a little syrupy but not too much body.

Minimal grain presence and no bitterness. The mouthfeel is thin bodied, adequately carbonated and semi dry in the finish. There is a little slick feel after the swallow but no aftertaste. Overall, ok. This is an extremely cheap and non-offensive way to deliver alcohol to folks who happen to hate bitterness or grain presence in a beer. I would advise to drink this one ice cold. It does get better as it warms.",3.02
Genesee Ice Beer,"A very pleasant surprise! I rate Genesee Ice highly not so much for being an exceptional beer in itself, but for its price-value ratio. At 5.5% ABV and as low as $8 for a 15 pack here in RI, its body, flavour and strength beat out all other popular cheap beers, many of which cost significantly more. Its little brother Genesee Light falls (and tastes) flat however. And unlike the other low-end beer brands, Genesee Ice doesn't wreak the same havoc in your stomach if you're drinking a lot, which you probably will be with it. Due to an ongoing sale, it's been my cheap beer of choice for months, but even if similarly priced with Bud, Rolling Rock or Narragansett, (my prior go-to's,) I would argue it's better in about every way.",3.5

L: crystal-clear, medium amber colored; good bit of white foam builds on pour, but immediately breaks down... actually some thin streaks of Belgian lace 
 
S: generic adjunct lager aromas; on the malty (liquor) side... slightly toasty, dry straw grain aroma; hints of spiced apple, maybe white grape; slight whiff of alcohol... bland sort of manila folder note as well... altogether uninspiring, dull 
 
T: rather dry, ever-so-slightly caramel-kissed, cereal-like malt base; strange notes of corn kernel and wet oxidized interior of lemon rind in finish/aftertaste... light, leafy bitterness begging to be intensified... the malt opens up a little, but its overall essence is of toasted corn syrup - a spicy ester away from being a mediocre maibock at best? 
 
F: slight touch of sizzle on the edges of what's essentially a marginally watered-down wort... light-medium bodied, delicate oily plushness 
 
O: industrial brewing being industrial... not sure why one would bother with a weaker version of a malt liquor - maybe it's a bit more daring of a drink than a light beer?... a beer seemingly caught between the better of two directions... buries Natty Ice, but I couldn't see getting this again",3.06

Smell - distinct Asian adjunct lager: slightly sweet, spicy, and some grassy hops. not super interesting, but not bad. 
Taste - sweetness indicating considerable rice, and comes with a light hoppy bite towards the end with a slightly malty finish. its watery, but the flavors are there. 
Feel - as light bodied as it can get, high carbonation, and not very boozy (so the 4.8% is probably an overestimate) 
Overall - one of the most commonly found beers across China, and the ""pure draft"" is even more popular than the flagship given its refreshingness: people do drink it like water! As such, I have some very fond memories with this beer...score reflects just a little bit of sentimentality.",2.92

From the CAN: ""Pure Health""; ""Draft"". 
 
I really debated on just how to open this one. It came with a throwback pop-top like Jimmy Buffett once sang about & just like the modern 360-degree opening CANs, I am less-than-enamored of a piece of metal that CAN become simply one more throwaway. Jeff Lebo showed me how to CANduct a bottom-opening of a modern CAN & I did so, using my late paternal grandfather's extremely pointy letter opener. The initial Glug was more of a dribble, but once it got going, it poured like a champ. In fact, there must have been an air pocket since it suddenly let go & really began flowing! It rose up to create nearly three fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, bone-white head before (thankfully) falling away in the day's heat & humidity. Color was Pale-Straw (SRM = 1- 2) with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled adjunct-free with a light maltiness and just a kiss of the hops. Rice? Maybe. Corn? Not so as I could tell, at least not on the nose. Mouthfeel was light, airy, watery, about what I have come to expect from Asian Lagers. Par for the course. The taste was lightly malty-sweet with a faint hoppiness, but again, no corn was discernible as an adjunct. It really did not taste too bad at all. I especially liked its lightness on this hot, humid Summer afternoon when it was just nice to cool off with a beer. YMMV.",3.66

Camo Black Extra,"Hello everyone. It's been a decade or two. It's been a long time since I found a new malt liquor, but the malt liquor expert is back. I saw something one the shelf called Camo Black XExtraX. I was hanging out with a 23 year old alcoholic and vaper took me to a vape shop where apparently all the kids are doing pastel-colored vapes and taking Delta-8 hemp-derived THC gummies and all the gaudy neon lights brought me back to the good old days of being a 23-year old degenerate. Our selections were informed by the very helpful recovering meth addict behind the counter who even provided legal advice on what I could and couldn't bring back to Florida with me when my vacation was over. 
 
Naturally, with all the nostalgia of legal loophole drug addicts taking me to weird head shops, I demanded we pick up ""a fowdie."" 
 
At the corner store, I was disappointed that OE now comes in 42 ounce containers. The fouwdie of my youth was gone. But there right next to it was the perfect thing I could have come across that night, a completely unfamiliar malt liquor. Furthermore, the sketchiest looking design I could possibly imagine. This would be a good night. 
 
Smell is pure acetaldehyde. May as well call this ""green apple flavored."" First swig reveals, again, nothing but a tart green apple flavor, with nothing else to accompany it. However, after a few swigs, a hint of acetone can be detected. 
 
All in all, fun night of debauchery. Would recommend. Pairs well with a forty and half a philly cheesesteak.",1.42

Coors Extra Gold,"Extra Gold Lager is a rich, full-flavored lager with a deep golden color. Starts with slow aged roasted (near toasty and you can taste it) malts, which are then combined with its other ingredients (ONLY: Water, Barley Malt, A Germinated Corn Grind for a little extra maltose, Coors own nearly bottom possible temp yeast, cascade hops certainly, but I can't get an answer on their strain. Likely typical lager finishing hops because this beer is ALL LAGER. If it was in a clear Miller High Life bottle with a redesign it would go from lawnmower beer to the top of the domestic lager game. It's a robust, beautiful, full, crisp, clean, and perfect example of an American Lager. Slow-brewed to produce this truly refined lager in an unassuming packaging at an unassuming price. If I were PR I would repitch it with a marketing strategy and get back to basics. They're too bloated and monopolized to realize a blind test would put them in the top 5 American Lagers. I picture a small Coors original shape bottle with the brown glass and the stubby style with the same price.

Coors Extra Gold,I can barely tell it apart from Banquet by flavor. Color slightly more golden. Excellent M-F classic American lager.,4.58
Coors Extra Gold,"The color is extra golden actually more like copper with a quickly dissipating white head of foam. 
 
Smells like it has a bit of some sour mash, maybe like sour malts. Got it! With that bread like lager smell this smells like a sourdough bread. Love it or leave it. 
 
The taste is pretty unremarkable or shocking. Tastes like a macro lager with a hint of sour. The sour is not offensive or overpowering. There is a bit of some sweet coming into play as well. 
 
Mouth is a bit more towards medium with that unusual sour and sweet. Finishes easy with just a bit of oiliness.  
 
Overall not a bad beer but more of what I would call it an inexpensive beer. Found this in a Colorado liquor store for 16.99 when I went back to Denver for a bit.

Aroma is not identifiable as beer. Smells like somebody added tequila to wine and let it sit out in the sun. 
 
Taste is exactly the aroma, but sweeter and with an offputting bitterness. Thankfully flavor doesn't linger.  
 
Feel is a redeeming value. Somehow this feels better than the camo 900 with a lower ABV in that there is much less of a syrupy feeling and everything fades incredibly fast making it at least consumable. Incredibly carbonated and is almost vapourous. 
 
Overall I should've known after giving Camo 900 a shot. The only redeeming value is the price/abv ratio is quite good.",1.28

L: crystal-clear, brassy gold colored liquid; foam loudly sizzles away upon pour... looks like sparkling apple cider; no lace, no collar 
 
S: initial aromatic pop includes sweetness/essence of pale malt leaping forward, backed quickly by what can only be described as spiced powdered donut or those Pfeffernüsse cookies... standard malt liquor smells, with only a mild extra kick of ethanol which, as it sits, later develops into an almost watery blended-Scotch and/or spiked used fryer oil scent... the raw booze does eventually take a lil precedence, but the malty wash in each sip snuffs out that sensation 
 
T: malt flavor almost has a lightly-buttery, shortbread/sugar-cookie quality - - that hits first, but a torrent of spicy, sweetish booze charges past, leaving a light peppery note up front in the palate, while the now vaguely syrupy malt bounces back to the middle of the palate behind the wake of fire... not terribly sweet, either balanced enough by the strident booze and/or the carefully-crafted degree of grassy/herbal 'imported' hops added... the more one gets into it, the more it tastes like a malt-loaded, low-abv apple brandy 
 
F: not too carbonated, not all that viscous, not much bite from the alcohol - rather dull on the palate, but it also doesn't quite feel like it's around 12%... I'd say champagne is more taxing to the senses... gotta get warmed up, but this is a walk in the park 
 
O: really not all that bad considering, well, everything about it... my brother and I, during the initial stages of a day-long beer tasting hang-out, shared a half a can last week and we both agreed, while it wasn't terrible, it could be difficult (without training) to get through a whole 24 oz solo... best to drink this from the can and relatively cold... would not be opposed to buying this again if the situation, feeling, and company called for it - could pair well with some battered whiting and a sweet potato pie; a little greasy mound of collards and a knuckle of corn bread would pull it all together rather splendidly",3.51

The sound of the can cracking open is getting me excited. It sounds like someone taking a big bite out of an apple. I’m not going to bother smelling it because it’s MALT LIQUOR and it is meant to be slammed. So here we go. I chugged ¼ of the can before my gag reflex decided to come to work. Taste sweet as hell and also taste like Dynatabe mixed with whiskey. No hiding the alcohol taste in this shit. This shit is revolting, putrid. Alright got ½ the can before the gag reflex kicked in again and gave me the shivers with goose bumps, the taste took my breath away. The label should say CAMO BLACK EXTRA the malt liquor that fights back. They should have a guarantee of your money back if you can finish the can, I doubt very few can. Alright at this point with ½ of the can left it’s a battle of who is going to win me or the CAMO BLACK.

I killed the can but it took me 30min to do it in, I must be getting old. I sit and do the math, I realized I drank a 6 pack in the form of one can. 
Alright overall the beer is good as a novelty at best. If you’re looking to get drunk then CAMO BLACK EXTRA is a guarantee.

Taste is of cheap, stale candy, overriding and highly unpleasant alcohol, and even a hop bite, if that can be believed. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, with a chalky under-taste.

Camo Black Extra,"There is no better description of the perfect beer than this. Very efficient, very cost effective, light on the calories for the punch it packs, and the perfect beer for drinking in a trailer park. If you complain about the ""burn"" of this, you probably should just quit drinking now. This is the perfect compliment to some good ol' McNaughton's Whiskey, Southern Comfort, or Wild Turkey. Wild Turkey chased with Camo always reminds me of this scene girl from back in the day who introduced me to Heaven's own blend of the two.  
You really just don't get much better than Camo Extra Black. The hangover is probably the best part, it lasts all of about 15-30 minutes, and then you're set to go for the day. Two or three cans of this and a fifth of R&R and you're set for a night of graveyard partying, streaking, and just good old blacked out fun.",5
Camo Black Extra,"Seeing as how Camo Black Ice was just about the shittiest malt liquor to pass these lips, it was only fitting to try the ""Extra"" version to *truly* plumb the depths of the worst beers on the planet. For science. Here's to bad decisions... 
 
Bright saturated orange color, rapid champagne carbonation, thin layer of white foam on the surface that does lace slightly. Audibly fizzy foam crackles like rice krispies.  
 
Smells like artificial grape flavoring, energy drink, and Flintstones vitamins.  
 
Tastes godawful. Very harshly astringent, vague paper and grape juice flavors, descending into utter malaise and ennui. Way overcarbonated and fizzy, rapidly fades into a numbing boozy aftertaste.  
 
Even drinking this as cold as possible doesn't help mask the terrible taste. If you are just looking to get drunk, whiskey is a far better option.

Labatt Max Ice,"Sunday Afternoon, November 2022 
 
On a cold rainy day, its time for some Ice beer. Poured aggressively into tall cylindrical pint glass ice cold from a frosty tall boy can. A very sleek industrial look to the can; with a name like Maximum Ice we could be talkng about close to anything here.  
Maximum ICE poured aggressively into a tall cylindrical pint glass. This lager beer is an aureate bronze with subdued carbonation from the pouring style. Atop the brew sits a sticky service envelope white head with big bubbles from the sugar used. It dissipates slowly and laces the glass well. Its a nice looking cold beer. 
Under the honker; aromas of wet brown bread, fresh sourdough, white salt crackers and a pinch of honey. The malt and bittering galena hops hit and create a pleasent fresh aroma; similar to a walk in refidgerator. 
Maximum ICE tastes of light caramel, English biscuits and a touch of table sugar. The hops bitter the beer and add some astringency and needed dryness. 
A highly drinkable lager beer of the ICE beer family. Maximum Ice has a refreshing and warming collection of light candied malts and well hidden alcohol. Its a nice beer. 
As we huddle in; Its a solid representitive of its style. I can certainly see this ICE beer pairing well with some ball park hot dogs or a huge bag of potato chips.",4.57

Labatt Max Ice,Got this in a 24oz can and it was in a cooler at the bottom of all the ice. Drank it directly from the can but poured some into a glass first. Not so bad iced cold. Definitely quenches the thirst or to have with burgers or hot dogs.,2.66

Labatt Max Ice,"This one poured very bubbly and fizzy at first, and then settled immediately into pond water. The color is a weak and tepid clear straw yellow. There's a lot of lacing. 
 
This smells horrid - wet stale leaves, old bread, metal, solvent, and green apple. 
 
This is absolutely disgusting, and not even worth the $1.99 it cost. It's just super stale, vegetal, and weirdly sweet and bitter all at the same and in all the wrong places. It definitely tastes like it brewed inside of an old work boot and left to ferment in the Death Valley sun.  
 
This is not drinkable, not even in the least, with a weird stale fruity bite on the back end. 
 
This is disgusting and should be drank by absolutely nobody.",1.57
Labatt Max Ice,,1.51
Labatt Max Ice,"Well I'll first say that I had this at a quite warm temperature, so I admit that it's certainly warmer than ideal, however I drink a lot of beer at rather warm temperatures though, and they still can get good ratings. 
 
Anyway, the smell was like a cheap beer: weak ""standard beer"" smell mixed with a bit of damp socks and/or urine. I suppse some corn too, which is maybe a bit different depending on what you think a typical cheap beer smells like. 
 
The pour was very bubbly with a huge head that dissipated extremely quickly and eventually left no head nor lacing at all after some sips, not even around the edges of the glass. (temperature could play a factor in this, but still I don't think I've ever seen a beer that this has happened with) 
 
The color was typical yellow like pee, with big bubbles everywhere like fresh carbonated soda. 
 
The mouthfeel was rather hollow. It had very prickly carbonation like a fresh carbonated soda, but it didn't maintain its power/foam with some swishes. 
 
Taste was metallic (VERY STRONG METALLIC TASTE), ""watery"" (I guess a lack of flavor) and otherwise just plain lacking, or dare I say ""bad"". While there was certainly SOME hops in here, it wasn't especially noticeable, nor was it a kind that tasted particularly good nor interesting in any way to me (just kind of generic bitterness/hopiness?). There wasn't much of maltiness taste to me either, or at least there was a lack of complexity/body to any maltiness that was there. I did quite easily notice multiple times a bit of ""corn"". If you've ever been to a brewery/distillery that uses corn fermentation you should know what I mean, but I suppose even eating fresh corn might give a bit of a similar taste. While senses can sometimes be deceiving/wrong, I believe that this beer must have been fortified with a corn-based low-filtration alcohol, otherwise I don't know why I'd be tasting any corn in this. Am I crazy to say this? I don't know if that's something that's ever done. Heck maybe it's a beer made mostly/exclusively from corn? is that possible? because that's kind of what it tastes like. 
 
I poured it from a 473 ml can (and also drank most straight from the can), which some might say contributed to the metallic taste, but I don't believe in that sort of thing. I don't find that cans affect the flavor in any sort of significant way; especially not to this extent. The last beer I had as a draft from a bar and it tasted very metallic and ""bad"" like this as well, which is an interesting coincidence (it might have been Labatt beer even for all I know, as it was just the house draft). I think the metallic taste is due to the carbonation (carbonic acid), and not being masked enough by any other flavors. Another way to describe it would perhaps be like a mild sodium bicarbonate solution, or club soda. Mix a bit of really cheap low-filtered/unfiltered corn vodka with some club soda and you'd probably be getting close to the taste of what I'm predominately feeling here. Obviously that's a bit of an exaggeration though. 
 
 
Unsurprisingly the 7% ABV isn't well hidden as it's an extremely prominent ""flavor"" as well. I do like that it has high ABV though, as I've found that I generally do like beers that have higher ABV, which is why I thought I'd give this a shot. However while it is a low price point for relatively high alcohol content, my go-to cheap high-ABV beer is MILES away better than this. Faxe Strong. At least where I live (Canada) Faxe is essentially the same price per ml as this, right around the bottom of what I think the minimum legal price is considering the ABV— or at least around the minimum of what's commercially viable in the country as well considering that they're individually canned and individually sold (although I suppose some are sold in packs as well). I wasn't expecting anything from Faxe Strong, but I was actually surprised at it being very good. It's one of my favorite reasonably-price high ABV-beers, right under most of the stuff that Unibroue produces (although Unibroue comes at a higher price point, still well-priced) 
 
Because of how much I disliked it, or rather how I disliked pretty much every aspect of it, I'm not sure how to even rate this. All I can say is that it's probably worse than anything commercial that I've had before, and is right around the bottom, just probably not worst possible. I'm sure it's possible to scrape lower without getting into non-commercial or spoiled/skunked beers. 
 
I don't know if this is a pro or a con, but I got to ""enjoy"" the beer over a long period of time due to it not being in any way delicious. 
 
So really anywhere between a 1 and a 1.75 (out of 5) seems reasonable to me. The main thing that you take from this is that in most citiess there should be no reason to buy this when there are better alternatives (at least at other stores)",1.46

Labatt Max Ice,"24 ounce can into lager glass, canned on 4/20/2018. Pours crystal clear deep golden amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of cracker, corn, white bread dough, toasted biscuit, light honey/nuttiness, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness. A bit of fruity/metallic aromas, but not overwhelming; mostly went away as it warmed. Nice an pleasant aromas with bready malt, corn, and mild earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, corn, white bread dough, toasted biscuit, light honey/nuttiness, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness. Very mild herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread dough, toasted biscuit, light honey/nuttiness, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness of bready malt, corn, and mild earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance; and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Very clean on lager flavors, with minimal fruity notes present. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a smooth, creamy/bready/grainy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Increasingly warming 8% alcohol, but not too rough of a finish. Overall this is a pretty good iced malt liquor. All around good robustness of bready malt, corn, and mild earthy hop flavors; very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV; with the mildly bitter/boozy finish. Clean and rich barely/grain flavors with mild earthy hop balance. Not overdone on the corn adjuncts. A nicely enjoyable, and well made style example.",3.53

This one pours a clean golden yellow color, with a small head, and lots of lacing. 
 
This doesn’t smell like a whole lot, really – some grassiness and grain but that it’s. 
 
This is definitely better than any Labatt that we get in the states, and I had it on a beautiful patio facing the Rocky Mountains. So, it tasted great, but that’s mostly a situational thing. It’s quite light, with no real flaws to it, but also no real distinct flavor notes to pull out, other than the cold crispness. The lack of flaws in a light mass-produced lager is something to note, though. 
 
This is crisp, clean, and very drinkable.

Kokanee,"The A-B USA version purchased in Oregon. Rated to style (which I like), and consumed straight from the bottle. 10-15 years ago, the BC version had an incredible lightness of being that made up for its lack of flavor because it seemed to be brewed with helium. Kokanee had a truly unique feel back then. This 12-pack is likely brewed in Fairfield, CA, and is a kinda interesting take on Budweiser. Completely neutral on smell. Mild beer aftertaste after the carbonation fades. It's a lighter Bud that omits some of the beery notes of Budweiser, but at the expense of the traces of complexity that still exist in the King of Beers. Going down, it has the same swallow taste/mouthfeel of Bud that reminds of jangling coins in your pocket. If you like Bud, this is decent, but its taste is an abbreviated, one-note Bud. This could be Bud: The Next Generation. At least it's still in bottles and better than the current Rolling Rock.",2.84

L - Looks kinda off-putting. A yellow, over carbonated pour with some soapy head. Resembles something between fresh urine and mop bucket water. But it's hard to actually fuck this up and it has a head so although it's not a pretty sight, it's not as much of a warning sign as it should be.  
 
S - It's the usual for a beer to rank poorly here because it has no discernible scent characteristics. It's not as usual for it to rank poorly because it actually smells unpleasant. This beer has its standard malty and corny smell, but intertwined with a chemical aroma that just doesn't belong there. It keeps reminding me of cleaner for some reason.  
 
T - I could give the actual account of taste, which is chemical doused corn and alcohol and not much else. But really the way I'd honestly describe it is like drinking regularly bad mass-produced beer, by pouring it on a shirt you've worn for a long time and wringing it out. It's oddly accurate to what you'd imagine, and just as off putting as it should be. Aftertaste lingers for too long, and is a haunting reminder of what just happened.  
 
F - Admittedly the mouthfeel is not horrific. It's actually kinda average. Not that light, little too carbonated, smooth enough, and goes down even if the entire trip is unpleasant. But it's not worth it.  
 
O - If you're not a broke alcoholic, you can be doing better. Hell, even if you are a broke alcoholic you probably can still do better. I refuse to believe that there isn't better options than this. Such as drinking antifreeze or huffing your own excrement.",1.55

The beer has a finger tall sudsy bright white head that reduces to a large patch of slightly mottled very thin film covering a little more than 65% of the surface of the beer and a thin ring at the edges of the glass. Light amounts of lacing are observed. 
 
S: Light to moderate aromas of grainy malts with a hint of rice + corn adjuncts and a light amount of grainy sweetness. Hints of grassy hops. 
 
T: Upfront there are just shy of moderate flavors of grainy malts with a hint of rice + corn adjuncts and a light amount of grainy sweetness. That is followed by very light flavors of grassy hops which impart a light to moderate amount of bitterness which slowly fades away. 
 
M: Slightly heavier than light bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Crisp with a clean finish. 
 
O: Easy to drink with well hidden alcohol and a pleasantly crisp, clean mouthfeel. Similar to the big AALs from American breweries, not bad but not something that I would seek out again. Would pair easily with foods and be refreshing in a very warm climate.",2.63

Castle Lager,Castle Lager is an excellent all around beer. It is your typical light lager but with just a touch of extra bitterness that makes the beer taste crisp and refreshing. It's good for hot summer days at the beach and good for barbecues. It's also a great beer after a hard days work no matter the season.,4.92

Schmidt,"This was a beer that I remember from my service days when I was stationed in Texas and Oklahoma.

Schmidt,"This rant review is in honor of 1980 NL MVP, Mike Schmidt... How did I see this beer in a variety of locations over the last 10 years, but now on a day when I visit the damn neighborhood where the brewery used to stand, I can't find a single can. They gave the bar at The Fire a new snazzy coat of paint, but no longer do I see Schmidt breweriana on the walls or cans in the their fridge... None of the other joints in the vicinity had it. Shame on you, Garage, with all your canned dreams, to not include a row for dear old Schmidt... I will find you soon, I know I will, and I'll do a proper review, even though I already know what you probably taste like... The above number ratings are based on Schmidt's 1979 stats. I'm sure his namesake beer smells of an 8, but I can't bring myself to give an overall 1... Don't mind me... Just delirious, playing with digits. (1980)",2.74
Schmidt,"Pours a crystal-clear straw yellow with a thin short lived white cap. Aroma is corn and biscuity. Flavor follows the nose, when ice cold it's a very modest priced refresher after drinking higher quality beers. I mean to say that there's nothing wrong with saving a few bucks after the taste buds are as buzzed as the rest of you. Feel is crisp and well carbonated. Overall, not a beer to write home about, but now that I'm retired, a cheap beer now and then works for me.",2.88
Schmidt,"I remember it being a decent beer for the money on a hot summer day.  
The 12-packs had the various sportsmen outdoors fishing and hunting motifs on the cardboard and the cans.

Schmidt,"A middle-of-the-road adjunct lager. Poured from 12-ounce can into a vintage hollow-stemmed goblet, mainly for looks. A center pour yielded a nice two-finger white head atop a clear pale-yellow body. Decent retention, some nice lacing, and good carbonation. That's about it. Aromas and flavors of corn, grassy hops, and tart cider. Light in body, not much bitterness. A little bit of fruity tartness lingers on the finish. Overall, not much here to offend the taste buds and the olfactory senses.",3.09
Schmidt,"When I was farming, I grew cereal grains, soybeans, corn, sunflowers and more. Schmidt doesn't taste or smell like corn! When you're combining, storing, augering or hauling barley, you know what it smells like. How many of you have been in the dust; it itches like heck! As a trucker, I hauled malted barley from Moorhead & Shakopee MN to Anhesuser-Busch in Baldwinsville, NY, Houston, TX & Stroh's brewery in N.J. Years ago, I toured Red Hook in Woodinville, WA too; ugh the coffee one was, well like coffee. I've hauled pearled, feed and needles barley. I know breweries and I know barley. I drink Schmidt BECAUSE it has an aftertaste. I drink it because it isn't a water-flavored beer. I slayed the Big Mouth bottles back in the day. I've sent emails to Pabst about bringing the Big Schmidty back, but to no avail. In my ratings, I don't believe in rating the ""Look"" or the ""Feel"", what for? How many of you rate the beer based upon the 2 row or 6 row barley varieties? Is it good in a can, yes; is it good it a bottle, absolutely! How would I change it? I'd add just a little more hops flavor. Love you all, but I love Schmidt more.",4.84

Appearance: Clear yellow, ok head. 
 
Smell: Mild corn. 
 
Taste: Mix of mild sweet corn and a slight sourness. It would be fine but then gives a butyric twinge. 
 
Overall: Continuing a mini-tour of sub-premium lagers, Schmidt used to be made in St. Paul and some signs can still be seen outside dive bars advertising it. My can had a bear on it. Beer wasn't bad, but wasn't too good either, with a weird sour note to it.",2.68

Look - The can is a vibrant red with a deer on it. It's a very honest and masculine can. The Schmidt logo would look good as a sticker in the back window of a pickup. 
 
Smell - Light and corny, simple and airy. A classic smell. 
 
Taste - Crisp and refined. Not too sweet, not too earthy. A really nice balanced flavor. Better than a lot of bigger name AALs. 
 
Feel - Thin and still. Could use a bit more pep in its step though. 
 
Overall - I had never heard of or seen this beer before, just bought a case on a whim. It's way better than I expected. It's a simple casual drinker, I could go through a lot of this.",4.11

Nice brown bottle with a a logo of a castle, go figure, but nice all the same.  
 
Appearance is one of a clear golden colour, with a white head that doesn’t stay around, some small carbonation going on, and overall the beer is not much to look at at all.  
 
Has a nice piercing smell of sweet corn, and a lager type aroma, very malty, grainy and lemony. Ok on the nose. 
 
Taste has nice warmish mouthfuls. Not a strong initial taste, and a bit flat. 
Bit metallic in initial taste, not nice, and in overall taste as well. Difficult to drink to be frank. 
 
Feck me this was a disgusting beer to drink. I felt a bit sick drinking it. It’s like a chemical infused beer with little thought given to flavours or tastes. 
 
Beer two. 
Taste is very hoppy, too hoppy, too much sweet corn and all a bit sour, hard to stomach especially for what is meant to be a lager. All in the front end. It’s a dead kind of taste. No, too hoppy for me, not nice.

This one pours a dark-ish golden brown color, with a small white head, and a little bit of lacing. 
 
This smells like licorice, peat, breadiness, caramel, dark chocolate, and some dark fruit. 
 
This feels pretty dang spot on for the style. There’s a nice earthy sweetness, some spice, some fig and raisin dark fruit notes, with a nice chocolatey creamy finish. 
 
This is medium bodied, creamy, with a nice warming feel to it. 
 
It’s fun to get a completely spot on take on this style from a Trappist brewery.",4.18
Tynt Meadow,"Poured from 330mL bottle into a dimpled mug. Date on the bottle is 7/27/24, so I'm going to assume that's a best-by date. The label says it's made in a place called Coalville, which ... seems legit. 
 
Appearance: rich red-brown hue with plenty of haze and a finger of creamy tan foam with a bit of an amber cast. Looks good! 
 
Smell: quite sweet, with a nutty, caramelly, and biscuity malt element. I must say, although it seems well-made, it's not particularly catered to my taste. 
 
Taste: sweet, caramelly, perhaps even with a hint of toffee. There's that biscuity finish, which I'm not as much of a fan of. This is definitely a sweet malty treat. I like it, although it's not perfect. 
 
Mouthfeel: medium body with a good carbonation and a nice smooth creaminess. Actually, the creaminess is more than good -- it's quite lovely indeed! 
 
Overall: I mean, I generally don't like biscuity beers. But this one holds most of that particular character in the aroma, so I'll give it a little bit of a pass. A nice dessert beer.",3.97
Tynt Meadow,"Lots going on in this one, hard to pick out all the flavors. Most of them are subtle, nothing overwhelming. But it's definitely a malty beer with bread and caramel. A slight feel of alcohol. Dark brown, medium/high carbonation. I would need another one to appreciate it better.",4

A - Deep cooper, mahagony color, gentle pour yields a thin off white cap. During the experience a steady production keeps a ring alive clinging to the glass. 
S - Brown sugar, a bit of anise, sweet malt, dark fruit , primarily raisin. There is a spicy thread in there, not quite pepper, not quite yeasty ester, but its there. 
T - Candied dark sugar, some licorice, again with that peppery thread, With a warm up, a really nice plum aspect develops 
M - Sweet start, stays in the lanes, fully coats the palate. just on the edge of sticky. A nice dry finish 
O - A very good Trappist, with all the elements. Make no mistake it leans hard to English Strong Ale. The peppery yeast, and dark fruit keep this lovely offering strongly in thr Trappsit camp",4.16

Tynt Meadow,"Pours a somewhat cloudy amber-brown and then full cloudy with a lot of yeast sediment; opaque in the glass; thin yet lasting light khaki colored head. Nice spicy nose; star anise and licorice; candi sugar sweetness smell; light suggestion of raisins. Spicy, malty flavors; anise, red licorice, and candi sugar; cloves; light cocoa on the backend; a touch booziness; very mild bitterness. Heavy mouthfeel; thick and sticky on the palate; a touch of boozy warmth. 
 
Other than a bit of over-carbonation overflow (likely due to the beer not being that cold - must have been just added to the store's coolers), there are no major flaws with this beer. I'll be back to pick up another sample and let it sit in the fridge a few days before re-trying the beer. I love the complexity and mouthfeel of this beer. A very nice find.

L: deep tawny-colored liquid, good clarity; tight, aged-white, finger-plus high foam pad... a med-thick collar maintains; laces only a little 
 
S: boldly smoky (and woody) in the vein of their other brands, but a whole new sugar-concentrated, dried-fruity, mildly sour-red-ale undertone that nearly matches the smoke in intensity... it's really sparking my interest, can't wait to drink 
 
T: the (non-smoke) flavors don't quite match the aromas, with the suggestion of fruity and sour tones pulling way back allowing a rather densely bread-crusty malt foundation to be front and center (almost like an Irish red)... the smoke is bold but not too intense, while there's a relatively acidic midtone lingering and even a whisper of earthy hops in the aftertaste 
 
F: med-light bodied and delicately silky in its initial swell... the intensity of the smoke stokes a tingly flame throughout the palate, up into the nostrils; my nose feels rosy...

Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours a medium to dark coppery orange with a one finber light khaki head with great retention and solid lacing. Looks great. Aroma of pale malt, smokehouse smokiness, hints of cherry and raisins. Flavor is lightly biscuit malt, smokehouse smokiness with umami, raisins, brown bread and mild cherry wood; light bitterness in the finish with residual wood smoke. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. I wasn't sure how this one would turn out, since I liked the bock versions much better than the lighter malt ones; in fact the bock Aecht beers are among my favorites. However, like their lighter lentenbier, the smokiness is tempered a little to fit the malt, which has more depth than I expected from the modest ABV. The faint cherry notes really added to my enjoyment. When I get a hankering for a rauchbier, the urbock and dopplebock are going to be my first choices, but I will definitely return to this too.

Nose is beef jerky, liquid smoke, and leather, though not as richly...beefy...as others in the line-up. Taste gets most of its smoke from the aroma, while on the palate, there is a much greater malt sweetness and light caramel. Perhaps this sweetness comes from the cherry wood used to smoke, but I feel like if the smokiness was peeled away, this would taste much like Helles.

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes neutral with a slight bite that dries it out over time 
 
Another winner from Schlenkerla. I’m glad I picked uo a 4 pack of this one when I stopped at OEC over the weekend, as well as the new-to-me Kräusen",4.23
Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel,"Fantastic Rauchbier, as one should expect from Aecht Schlenkerla. This style, at a fairly low ABV, doesn't lend itself to the strong smoke as well as their more malty offerings; there's just not enough depth and complexity on the palate (although, oddly, there is a decent amount of sweetness). 
 
The smoke itself is wonderful, and you can really pick up the difference from cherry wood than from other smoke choices. The aroma is nothing short of delightful, a campfire blending notes of wood smoke, meat smoke, and dark fruit. 
 
Drinks clean and easy, with a body a touch thicker than you might expect for the ABV, but which fits this beer very well.",4.3

Negra Modelo,A great beer and fan of Modelo always!,4.69
Negra Modelo,"It reminds me exactly of a better version of Michelob™ Dark, and I'm talkin the 'Don't be afraid of the dark' era with Martin Mull, circa 1987 - 1992. It's a very drinkable, not heavy dark beer. Very malt forward, so there's no confusing this for an IPA! But with this beer, that's a good thing!",3.34
Negra Modelo,"It tastes okay. Its not a heavy taste but its not a light taste either. I'm not much of an alcohol drinker so two is enough for me and it makes me feel mellow/ relaxed. It would be great to taste this with a shot of Evan Williams in it. Dark beer with a shot of Evan Williams in it just tastes awesome. The packaging is very nice with the gold foil top. Beautiful. I also really like the short chuby bottles, just a nice presentation / well done.",3.56
Negra Modelo,,3
Negra Modelo,"Presentation wise, the bottle has a very comfortable shape to hold, and it comes in a gold foil wrapper, so every beer feels like you’re unwrapping a gift. It’s a dark lager, so of course it tastes good. I wish it was a few dollars cheaper, but it’s a good beer to pick up once a blue moon.

Negra Modelo,"From the back of the bottle, printed on glass with white ink spots: ""BB NOV 2023 C273B159 11:14."" 
 
Appearance: The body is a medium shade of dark brown with light hints of golden brown and burnt umber. It is a dark beer but it has good clarity and ample carbonation bubbles are clearly visible. There is a medium-sized head which mostly has larger bubbles but there are smaller ones surrounding them. It has a tobacco-stained off-white head. The head retention is pretty good and it slowly fades out to a short cap. No real lacing. 
 
Aroma: There is a light toasty caramel scent with a light nutty yeast note. 
 
Taste: It has a light toasted caramel flavor up front. The middle of the palate has a bit of a bread character with a nutty flavor. It has a bit of a walnut and acorn character. Some pecan notes come through eventually too. A bit of alcohol develops after a few sips. The aftertaste is a light herbal bitterness. 
 
Mouthfeel: It straddles the edge between light and medium bodied. It feels more medium as it first hits the palate but it doesn't have much texture when moving to the back. Carbonation feels high but good. There is a mild but noticeable bitterness. 
 
Overall: The text on the label states that this is a ""Medium-bodied lager with slow-roasted caramel malts brewed for a rich, smooth taste."" That is a pretty fair description of the beer. The body feels a tad low but it is a nice beer to drink. It has a nutty flavor and aroma which gives the beer more depth as well. I probably wouldn't buy it regularly but it's an enjoyable beer.",3.33

Nooner Pilsner,"12 oz bottle poured into a pilsner glass. Look is clear light gold with a white head that falls to a thin cap. Lively in the glass as carbonation races up through the body. A bit of lacing left as you sip. Smell is bold as bready malt, earthy, spicy hops, and a bit of black pepper leap out. Taste is sweet bread up front, then a bit of bitterness kicks in with the hop spiciness. The finish has a bit of apple/pear rind, and an almost flint like character. The finish is fairly clean in the end. Mouthfeel is light bodied, crisp, very inviting. Carbonation cleans up the palate nicely. Overall, this is a fan favorite for a good reason. It can be as complicated of a beer as you want; drink it fast without a thought, sip and contemplate the different components, either way it delivers.",4.21

Oktoberfest,"Not a fan of this one. Looked great in my Sam Adams Oktoberfest mug, but went downhill from there. Aroma foretold the sweetness that was to come. Also some earthiness and slight alcohol comes through. Flavor wise, it's too sweet for my liking, but did have a little roasty earthiness to it and a slight bitterness on the end. Not enough to save it though. Alcohol poked out as it warmed. Glad I only bought a single.",3.34

Oktoberfest,"Having lived long enough in Austria to be able to tell what makes a good marzen. And this one, I know for sure is an excellent take on it. The good thing is that it doesn’t try to carbon copy a marzen but it takes it further instead: makes the malts more caramelized, puts more hops into the aroma and brings more richness and excitement into the whole deal. 
Sometimes marzens can get too sweet and overwhelming but this one does not. This one feels like a “craft marzen” and not just a regular one but one made in the US - which made me realize once again how great and outstanding American craft beers are. 
Oktoberfest and a German marzen gets born again to beome a hop infused, fresh and excellent craft brew with full of life. I liked it a lot, never get disappointed by Founders.",4.24

Oktoberfest,"Poured into a grip shaped goblet: color is copper, transparent, head presents 1/2 inch thick and dissipates quickly to thin top, spotty lacing on the glass sides.  
 
Smell is caramel, toast, honey malt, light earthy hops.  
 
Taste is thinner than most American Oktoberfests, threads the Marzen/Festbier styles with a grainy flavor intermixed with the caramel and german malts; limited grape nut like note with more caramel/honey flavors.  
 
Mouthfeel is lighter on the carbonation, moderate sweetness, crisp finish.  
 
Overall this presents as a hybrid of the Fest/Marzen styles - more grainy-ness, less munich malt than the sweeter Oktoberfest (americanized versions) and more caramel than the lighter 'Festbier' styling.",3.73

Oktoberfest,"A: The beer is crystal clear yellow in color and has hues of orange along with a light to moderate amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a short white head that quickly settled down and left a thin collar around the edge of the glass. 
S: Moderate aromas of sweet malts are present in the nose. 
T: The taste follows the smell but is also accompanied by a moderate amount of bitterness and hints of spiciness from the hops. 
M: It feels a bit more than light-bodied and a bit crisp on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation. There is some dryness in the finish. 
O: This beer seems to be much lighter in body compared to other beers in the style. It's easy to drink, but not as malty.

New,"375ml pull-tab can from Bottle Mart, Port Douglas, Australia. 
 
Insipid with a cheap malt taste at its core (6-row would be my guess) and some odd vague breadiness/doughiness towards the finish. In short, it's pretty bad, but it isn't syrupy or watery so I suppose it's drinkable. In any case, I reckon going off memory it's the worst Australian beer I've tried to date.

New,"Tooheys New. The pride of New South Wales. ANother mainstream Aussie adjunct lager, it's a NSW icon, much like VB is to Victoria, XXXX Queensland, Emu Export to WA and West End to SA. It's not something i've had in a while, as previously I found it too sweet for my liking. But let's give it a fair crack... 
 
Look: Standard Aussie Macro lager. Deep Golden Straw, filtered, highly carbonated. Head was non existent and has faded to a thin foam on top. Lots of cascading bubbles rising to the top. Standard stuff.  
 
Smell: Wet grassy hops, from the standard Pride of Ringwood hops, which also gives a slight sour lemon/citrus nose, pale malt sweetness. Smells like an Aussie adjunct lager  
 
Taste: Heavy biscuit malt and grain flavour throughout the sip, a tiny fizz of bitterness towards the end with a slight citrus twang. Pretty clean and smooth. Carbonation is heavy, and takes over the flavour of the beer quickly.  
 
Feel: Highly carbonated, so refreshing when drunk ice cold. It's clean, easy drinking especially if you're just after something to drink without thinking about complex flavours.  
 
Overall: it's better than what I remember from my young adult days of drinking this stuff because it was one of the cheaper options on the market, but it's pretty bland to be honest. There's not a lot going on flavour profile wise, and the heavy carbonation does not assist in keeping the flavours around. Having said that, you need to drink this ice cold - much like VB as once it warms up it starts to turn proper funky. A decent enough lager to quaff quickly on a hot summers day,",2.4

I have been drinking beer for over 40 years. I never drank “American” beers even when I started as a teenager in the 1980s. I worked my way through every funky, high alcohol import I could find back then and loved them all. 
Pilsners, Porters, Ales, IPAs, clear, cloudy, thick, thin, you name it. Every variation I could find.

Probably why large Belgium brewery purchased them. 
 
But, back to the whole point of this; New Belgium's new trip into Voo Doo Ranger brand growth. 
 
I drink all of them, especially the Imperial IPA which is my preferred, but in the scorching Texas heat, it is nice to have a strong IPA, with hints of fruit and citrus, that tastes light, but gives you a bang for the buck. 
 
Now, there a many other Belgium Golden Ale's that blow this Juice for IPA out of the park, but for the price, it's not bad, if you are just chilling in the heat, and want some refreshing beer.

Tucher Nürnberger Rotbier,"Can: 
This isn’t the prettiest body to look at, with a muddied red ale look to it, though it has a decent and sustained head to make up for it. Based on what I read and my experience, this version of the style seems a little bit in between the maltiness of a Marzen and a mildly hoppy red ale. 
 
The toasted malts drive the flavor, and a tea-like to earthy to dark nut bitterness evolves to keep the malts from expanding on the sweetness they provide. The nose is of a medium grain bread, which comes through in the taste. At times the flavor reminds me of a breakfast bread that someone left the sugar out of, or at least mis-measured it on the low side. 
 
Other more minor notes include a little malt tang and some medium strength iced tea. In fact that tea sensation feds into a dark nutty bitterness, the one that continues to balance the malt sweetness, even as it strengthens a little bit as the beer warms. This warmth also brings a bit of a little bit of molasses to the aroma and taste, which I didn't notice when it was colder. Overall, a malty beer that doesn't run sweet with a bitterness that compliments the malt quite well, in my opinion.",4.17
Tucher Nürnberger Rotbier,"A: Pours a near opaque reddish/orange color. A towering beige head forms with excellent retention and lace all the way down the glass. 
S: A big malty presence. Toasted, biscuit, toffee, dark fruits. The malt character is incredibly inviting, and like some of their other beers, reminds me of walking into a bakery. 
T: Again, all the malt character you could want. Dark toasted and baked bread. Toffee/caramelized malts and dark fruits. Certainly sweet, and a rich malt profile. Though far from cloying or unbalanced in anyway. I just love the malt character here. 
M/O: A full body with crisp carbonation. That also becomes ultra smooth and silky. This feels like it should have more ABV. Though because it is not high in that regard, this is incredibly moreish to drink. 
 
I love the rich malty character here. In that regard it is almost in the Doppelbock range, but with a much lower ABV than is typical for that style. Which makes this all the more easy and inviting to come back to. All around well done.",4.25

F: Brisk, firm, lightly creamy medium-bodied feel with a smooth middle and a medium-length finish that is quite drying on the tongue.

The taste is also nicely hoppy, but too me it is not overdone...semi-sweet cracker like malt greets first, tastes sort of like a mix of water cracker and ritz to me, then come the hops; very grassy, hay like hops; after the sip goes down the herbal nature hits in the aftertaste. 
 
Bigger side of light bodied; hops are tongue coating and then the bitterness hits moderately on the finish; this beer doesn't not finish the driest or crispiest but it still finishes quite clean for me; the drying sort of builds but it’s still has this minor lingering malt presence.",3.85

This is a massive cuvée, using a blend of 7 different component beers. Given the lineup of beers in the blend, I have a hatd time believing that this will be anything short of amazing. Let’s crack it open and see what it’s all about 
 
Pours almost completely pitch black with 2 fingers of creamy dark tan head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing 
 
The nose is definitely sweet, but in a complex way that doesn’t become cloying. I’m picking up on aromas of dates, toasted oak, toasted walnut, molasses, black cherry, sweet bourbon, brown sugar, milk chocolate, light caramel, and orange peel 
 
It’s even a touch sweeter in taste but still so well executed. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting black cherry, molasses, cocoa powder, dark toast, burnt caramel, brown sugar, raisin, toasted oak, sweet bourbon, and poached pear. The swallow brings notes of toasted oak, molasses, sweet bourbon, black cherry, orange peel, cocoa powder, brown sugar, vanilla, toasted coconut, and light raisin 
 
A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer. Finishes mostly dry and drinks well below its abv

Strong oak presence, slight dark fruits covered in confection, roasted malt, bringing a very faint chocolate and coffee, and some hop presence. The ethanol heat doesn't seem to be too strong on the palate. It is drying, but it doesn't illicit images of deserts in your mind. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied. Almost no carbonation. Overall a great brew. I didn't realize this was a whopping nearly 16%. I thought it was around 14%.

Deep oak chars, vanillin and peppery whiskey introduce the infinite complexity of this incredible blend that only gets better as it warms. It deftly avoids being oversaturated, decadent or sticky with an illuminating carbonation--for lack of a better word to describe how it unveils layer after layer of novel characteristics--that helps it to nearly vanish in the finish. 
 
The less than viscous medium body actually improves the expressive delivery of its idiosyncrasies. I can't get over the depth here, particularly how I'm failing to find descriptors that do it justice, but even more astonishing is how there isn't really any burn despite the nearly 16% ABV.",4.76

Blanche De Chambly,"12oz Bottle, best by January 31st 2025 
 
On the pour, it looks like a lot of the haze has settled out, but with a solid swirl of the bottle, this becomes incredibly hazy, with some larger particles of sediment. The body is an obviously hazy deep orange, and the head is fine, but not super long lasting. 
 
The aroma is super yeasty but surprisingly malty. Not as much citrus as expected from a wit, but my sense of smell isn't fully here right now. Definitely has some Belgian yeast phenols and to a lesser extent esters. 
 
Taste is lightly bitter, carrying over some subtle but present Belgian funk from the aroma, but it works well with the bready, but crisp malts. There is light citrus and the coriander is lightly present and again works very well with the malt and bottle conditioned characteristics. A bit lighter than expected from Unibroue, but again my sense of smell is weak. 
 
Feel is incredibly smooth and drinkable, but with a velvety full malty quality as well. Super refreshing and dry as well. This is just a great feeling beer. The best of all worlds. 
 
Overall this is a solid and uniquely Belgian (oxymoron right?) Take on a witbier. Solid yeast character backed up by subtle additions of Spice and orange, but a nice big and full wheaty malt. I would really like to revisit this soon.",3.98

Appearance: Light black bodied beer with a thin cap of light brown colored head. The head drops down to nothing. This has booze legs for sure.  
 
Smell: There is a lot of oak, bourbon, and barrel notes to be had. It leans towards stout notes, but caramel/brown sugar notes are also easy to pick out here.  
 
Taste: Caramel, toffee, brown sugar & vanilla notes of the Ryeway & Gravedigger components which are rich and satisfying right out of the gates. Starting around mid-palate you start to get some darker flavors & barrel notes including hints of dark chocolate, light smoke/barrel char, leather, molasses, and tannic oak. As for the finish, the dark flavors fade into a balanced barrel finish with dry mature oak notes punching through and the return of some more brown sugar and toffee notes with the addition of some maple & nutty notes as well. Incredibly complex. Delicious barrel aged beer here.  
 
Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with low moderate carbonation. Incredibly drinkable beverage here.

A: pours a quite dark, crystal-clear copper-orange/amber. One finger white head recedes to a splotchy thin skim of foam. Little visible carbonation. Heard dissipated faster than I’d like. 
 
S: (recovering from a cold), and straight from the fridge): get a little cherry tootsie pop malt sweetness with that dried fruitiness mixed in. Very much like the sweeter Marzens and barleywines I’ve had. Toasty, rich malt as it warms. Right to style for a Marzen, I think. 
 
T: interestingly, the malt complexity and fruitiness are there on the palate, but the sweetness isn’t. Somehow manages to have a rich, complex toasty malty flavor without being too sweet. Toward the end, the combination of malt, fruit, and noble hops makes it seem cloying, but it really isn’t. This is an enigmatic Marzen, in being sweet without sweetness. Finishes quite clean. Goes right up to the line of being cloying without crossing it. 
 
M: heavier side of medium, finish is not entirely clean; a little slick. Very low carbonation. Could be a touch cleaner, but superb. 
 
O: my favorite Marzen/festbier straddle the line between the old-fashioned and modern styles. This is clearly in the old-fashioned Marzen category, but is almost perfectly executed. The head fell fast, and it says a touch under-carbonated (in my opinion). My only qualms with this beer that would stop me from buying more are the things I dislike about the style. 3F did a great job, even though I wouldn’t buy this again. I tend to grade hardest on the styles I like the most, and I like this style, so take that for what it is.",4.15

Munsterfest,"12oz bottle purchased from the fridge as a single for $1.99. ""BOTTLED 07-21-22"" is etched on the glass, so that makes this beer just over 4 months old. 
 
Look: Pours an almost clear light to medium copper color. Initially, there was a decent khaki-colored head but it reduced to just a ring around the rim of the glass and a very thin glacier atop the surface. The beer appeared to be perfectly clear until pouring the last few ounces. After pouring the entire bottle into the glass, this beer has a mild, soft haze to it. 
 
Smell: Malt-forward with notes of spice, apple orchards, caramel, and toffee. It has a nice rustic bready aroma. Peppery notes also. 
 
Taste: It is balanced and pretty drinkable. Up front, it has nice bread crust flavors along with some caramel and apple flavors. The finish is very crisp and has a spicy bite to it with a touch of bitterness. The finish especially reminds me of apple-cinnamon and ginger herbal tea almost. If this didn't have all of the spicy notes on the finish, this would remind me of a JW Lee's Harvest Ale. It's good, just tastes like it's missing something though. 
 
Feel: The body on this beer is a bit thin in my opinion for being a Marzen and 6.2% ABV. It also feels like it is slightly under-carbonated. 
 
Overall: I'm pretty sure that this is my first lager from 3 Floyds. It's a solid Marzen offering from an American brewery. I have had better and I have had worse. Granted I am reviewing this beer at 4 months old; however, I don't think that it has suffered much due to age. I would try this again, but probably only as a single.",3.83

It is round-feeling and has a pretty rich malt character all the way through the finish, medium carbonation. Honestly a more complex beer than I was expecting, but still a little hollow and one-note in a way industrial lager all is.

Refreshing aroma of dry slightly aromatic hops. Small bubbles in the head, looks pretty good. 
 
Yes it's definitely different from a usual German pilsner. The hops are a little more aromatic, sophisticated and kind of Japanesey. It's super light and dry a bit like Asahi, but the hops seem to have more flavour and it's kind of sweet. This would go perfectly with sushi for sure..  
 
It's the kind of beer that is refreshing initially, but becomes a little boring as you drink more of it. It's a little too sweet for me and needs some more hops to balance the sweetness, but I do like the hops flavour and the light dryness.

Big juicy fruit bubble gum aroma off pour, backed by a bit of noble hop spice, and slightly ameliorated by some classic pale ale apple aroma as warms. On tasting, begins sweet, juicy fruit bubble gum like the aroma, over a nice smooth, light malt base, with a bit of that APA apple showing in the flavor before a little herbal hop bite cuts the bubble gum for the finish.

Hazy Rays,"12oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for $2.99. PKG 02JUN23, so this is like 70 days old (2 months plus). 
 
Look: It is quite hazy, but not super turbid or opaque looking. It's still somewhat translucent. It's yellowish orange in color, leaning towards yellowish. It looks a lot like white grapefruit juice. There was about a finger of whitish head that dissipated to ring around the glass. 
 
Smell: Tons of grapefruit on the nose. After swirling the glass, I get some medicinal notes? Perhaps a bit chalky and reminiscent of chewable vitamins. This sounds weird but I also get a subtle butterscotch-flavored hard candy note, very much like a Brach's or Dum Dum lollipop. Some earthy and grassy notes on the finish. The nose is actually relatively closed and not so expressive. 
 
Taste: Interesting. There's something bizarre about this beer; up front, it tastes like a lot of other hoppy citrus-forward beers, lots of grapefruit character. But then you swallow it, and there's almost no bitterness and it almost feels like you are drinking a soda. It's really weird and I just don't get it. The finish is very short and thin. 
 
Feel: Highly carbonated with a carbonic acid / soda- or seltzer-like feel. The finish is very short and thin. I would say that this beer is light to medium bodied. 
 
Overall: This beer fell short for me. Overall, I've been pretty impressed with Lawson's Finest Liquids but this offering is not my cup of tea. I'm not sure if they are trying to cater to a different kind of audience or what but I would say that this beer does not appeal to old school beer drinkers.

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's surprisingly light in color, just a straw gold, which leads me to believe it's got a lot of oats in it. What's the strength on this one? It's just 5.3% (.3 more than Budweiser) which explains a lot as well. It's definitely hazy, and maybe even cloudy like a hefeweizen. The head is a finger's width of bright white foam that doesn't look like it's going to hold up any better than most. In the nose it's got some hop resins to it, and fruity notes of orange and mango. The flavor delivers a fairly light maltiness that does include a bit of oat, but I'm not clearly getting wheat. The hops remain mainly orange-like in character with some additional mango and apricot. It's not a bold beer in any way, and keeping with that the bitterness is limited. In the mouth it's light-medium in body and silky smooth across the palate. This is an easy drinking beer that's got a lot more character to it than most beers of 5%, and although it won't knock Founders All Day IPA off my top rack as a session IPA (it's just 4.7% and hoppier) it's a fairly good option.

The Greenest Green,"This one pours a very hazy glowing orange color, with a small head, and lots of lacing. 
 
There’s a ton of funky and sweet pineapple on the nose here, some tropical fruit, orange tangerine, and just the lightest floral aroma. 
 
Green is a perennial favorite from Tree House, and this is the stickiest and most greentastic version of that I’ve had yet. It’s just super saturated and thick with hop character, without tasting syrupy. There’s loads of the expected pineapple and mango here, with tons of orange and tangerine citrus, and very little bitterness. It’s just got that extra little push beyond Green or Very Green – it’s not a full on uppercut, but it’s definitely a hard shove. 
 
This is thick and creamy, with a wonderful drinkability, and no hint at all of the 8.8% ABV. 
 
It’s honestly old hat at this point, this is wonderful, of course it is. Tree House has come out of the other side of their expansion extremely successfully.",4.53

Pours an orangey yellow with lots of haze and a middling white head. Little lacing. Nose is pineapple and bitter orange, resiny oils, little detectable malt presence. The flavor is a wee, little burst of the rinds of those fruits followed by a big (but shortlived) wave of those same fruits… but this time just their bitter, oily, perfumey aromatics. This then dissipates into a lingering, bitter hop buzz and not much else. The mouthfeel is less of that classic round, fluffy juiciness and more total hop saturation. That said, it is quite pleasant and doesn't venture into sappy or hop burny or astringent territory. As it warms, some of the hoppy-yeasty estery sweetness as well as a scoche of malt character come out, but even then it is a one-two-three punch (that's a thing, right?) of the two main facets of the hops: Sweetbitter-bittersweet-bitter in quick succession. Regardless of any way the the beer could be better, this back and forth shift with ever sip is extremely enjoyable and impressive to have pulled off from a brewing perspective. 
 
In looking through my reviews of a few of its predecessors, I can see how it is a clear extension of them. The main thing I notice is that in previous amped-up versions, the fruity sweetness held its own and offered a foil to the bitter resinous palate shellac potential contained within the hop profile.  
 
In this particular beer, though, the bitter oiliness has overtaken the rest and I have to really seek out the non-bitter aspects of it.  
 
They say on the can that this is a result of their series to see how far they could push the envelope before it was too much. Yeah, I could see that. Interesting to have this bitter of a Treehouse beer.

Notes via stream of consciousness: I've just sampled the Hazy Squall so I'm wondering what this is. The label says that it's a ""double golden ale"" with grapefruit juice, lime peel, and blue agave nectar. OK then. It's poured a hazy golden body beneath a finger's width of white foam. The aroma expresses grapefruit and light malt. On to the flavor then, it's surprisingly sweet. It tastes like a grapefruit candy. I didn't get any of the lime peel in the nose but I get some of it here. I get a little bit of alcohol but not much. The malt is sweet and lightly grainy, bready, and oat-like. I like it and it works well to support the fruitiness that's there. Grapefruit is generally a bitter fruit but I'm not finding that here. There's some coming out in the finish but I would think it would be more bitter overall. That's OK, I like it. It's a one-trick pony but it's a good trick. I generally think of fruity beers like this as multiple serving beers but not this one. It's 8% ABV to start, and although it's sweet I think that after two or three that bitterness from the grapefruit will start to build. I also think that you'll just be bored with it by then regardless of how good it is to start with. On the negative side, the head did not hold up well, and thus it left next to nothing in terms of lacing. I really like this but it is a kind of a one and done beer, although at 8% that's not necessarily a bad thing, I think it's nicely balanced and rounded, and quite enjoyable. If you love grapefruit you've gotta get Citrus Squall.

Citrus Squall,"Picked up a sixer last week at Shoppers in Germantown. Seemed a good match for all the heat we've been having. nose is grapefruit and lime and I guess agave. Flavor brings the sour citrus early and then flattens in out, where the aftertaste is complex yet clean. Not really what I'm looking for from a flavor or style standpoint, and I am in no ways a tequila drinker, but this is actually pretty good for what it is. You don't taste the eight percent much either. For eleven bucks a sixer you could do a lot worse.",3.99

This isn’t as good as Zombie Dust – that’s an all-time classic. But it’s still cool to see an amped-up version of it. It’s lightly malty, but not as much as you’d expect. It’s very orange-y, with lots of grapefruit, with marijuana and clean piney bitterness.

Taste is of generic fruit, with lots of astringent rind. That rind is what makes it a little different from a hundred other NEIPAs, but there's nothing about it that screams ""Treehouse"". 
 
In summary, a competent NE(D)IPA, but nothing I'd go out of way for (which puts it below most Treehouse beers).",4.28

Pours milky white-yellow with a middling head. The aroma is fairly punchy upon popping the can. Generic tropical fruit. Once in the glass, however--while still nice-smelling--this punchiness is a bit diminished and still just generically fruity. The flavor has a bit more of a thin bitterness than expected or suggested by the nose. This lingers into the finish. Not quite ""juicy"" either in taste, smell or body. The mouthfeel is along similar lines. A little fluffiness, but not quite as luxurious as I am used to with their beers. A little astringency but not quite astringent. It feels weird to not just pound in my normal 4.75s for look and feel on a TH beers. We're in strange times... 
When I saw what they were doing for the Data Set series I was bummed I'd missed it, but I am really glad to be able to taste what came out the other end (Thanks, Papillon senses!).  
 
Still, not a fan. First off, maybe it's the power of suggestion, however as a fanboy I REALLY wanted to like it so where does that leave us? Secondly, this was a little on the older side yet not only did none of what I picked up jibe with age, but at the brewery I had a very fresh one with the same yeast and got the same overall impression; on a different day, in a different setting. Finally, the other beer I had (Velvet) was all new-fangled hops that I don't have much experience with. However, this one was good old standbys that not only do I know well but I know well specifically in TH beers.  
 
What it all comes down to for me is that whether it's a good biotransforming yeast strain(s) or not, the ester profile is sorely, sorely missed and in its place there is an ever-so-slight astringency (not the most adequate word, maybe hollowness?) to the hop character that takes away from the beer. I am far from an expert but have had a lot of their beers at multiple stages of my life as a beer nerd and their life as a brewery. That first smell and drink of a TH beer is always obviously a TH beer and it has always been exquisite. This one was not obviously theirs in that sense and was ""very good"" at best. No audible gasps here. That's a first for me (or in this case a second after Velvet).  
 
Anyway, I am extremely happy to have tried this. It was a really educational experience. It reinforces my belief that even though you can load something down with hops and get something delicious, in the best of NEIPAs the yeast's ester profile is doing at least as much for the overall character. If you count biotransformation, maybe even more.  
So, as they say: If it ain't broke don't fix it.

Pours a murky, utterly opaque milky-orange with a finger-plus of super-soft, creamy head. Retention is excellent, leaving a sudsy cap and a solid sheet of foamy lacing. This is what NEDIPA looks like. 
 
Nose is creamy sweet and all-over squishy jungle fruit - aromas of ripe pineapple and mango ice cream. 
 
Taste is dank as the dickens, less sweet and creamy, and with more rindy bitterness than anticipated. Tasting grapefruit rinds and woody underripe pineapple cores, grapefruit juice, mango skins, orange peel, sandalwood and bhang water. A little pardonable onion. 
 
Feel is juicy, medium-plus bodied with bright, tingly carbonation. Hop oils and carbonation combine in a peppery tongue-coating firecracker assault. Spot-on relative to the style. 
 
Overall, dank and juicy as is thoroughly right and proper. Legitimately bitter albeit in an unripe fruit peel sort of way. The can promises me a ‘lush wave of overripe pineapple’ but I found the pineapple to be underripe and woody and could easily have believed that I was tasting a ‘touch’ of Simcoe rather than of Citra.

This is just a really good barleywine at this point. We're so far beyond IPA that it's kind of comical they still market it as such.

Modelo Especial,"This is the best beer you can buy at 7-Eleven. It has a decent amber color, and it tastes good. Like Beer. It's fairly smooth, without an unpleasant aftertaste. It's a step above your average adjunct lager. When I'm tired of the heaviness of stouts, and the bitterness of IPAs, I enjoy a glass of this beer. It reminds me of when I was young, having a beer with my dad, or drinking with my friends.",3.61

Modelo Especial,"Look: Crystal clear dark yellow and my pour kicks off a tornado in the glass that doesn’t stop and helps build a great head that settles to a lid, leaving decent lacing behind 
Aroma: Cereal grains, floral hops, soda crackers, some pilsner malt, and a little lightstruck skunk note 
Taste: Grains, pilsner malt, and crackers join forces on the initial hit and are quickly followed by stronger-than-expected floral hop notes. Malt and hops trade off throughout the middle and on the close, floral hops finish on top 
Mouthfeel: Light but not too watery, clean, medium-high carbonation, and crisp and clean on the finish 
Overall: I dig it. Outside of Victoria and Negra Modelo, this is my favorite Mexican chela and top dog if I’m going for the Pilsner-esque style of Mexican lager. More flavorful than others to me and a good floral hops presence for a macro keep me coming back whenever the calling comes – evening BBQ, work party, fishing, camping, hot weather chilling, etc. Fun to slow down and finally review it",3.46

Very neutral grain, honey-corn sweetness, light herbal bitterness.

However, I don't think I will be buying it again because I prefer other beers from similar companies. Nothing wrong with this beer, it's just a bit dry and the flavor is of corn and raw dough.",2.95

Clear dark red in color, basically chestnut. Capped with a nice creamy off white head. Excellent retention and lacing. 
 
Smells like rye, peppery, spicy; sweet, burnt sugar; pine cones/sap...? 
 
Taste smacks hard of pumpernickel bread, burnt sugar, molasses, red velvet cake...but rather than go cloying, the sweetness gets cut with pine sap, pine needles, black pepper, fennel, red grapefruit peel. Nice bitterness and spice cuts through that sweetness. Rich and malty, nice body, chuggable. Creamy carbonation. Nice piney bitterness but doesn't overwhelm. Scrubs the palate clean save for a lingering slickness.

Something dark fruit like, pungent caramelize citrus character, toasty and bark like, light sweet sappiness.  
 
Taste is a really neat mix of all sorts of hop and malt; the hops are gently fruity like but quickly become biting with bitter citrus rind and light pine, the malt lends a nice touch of toast and some caramelization.  
 
Clean and easy drinking; noticeable lingering bitterness, smoothly carbed with a dry finish that really pairs nice with the bitter; hops give so nice stickiness to this beer.

Bear Republic, bring it back. X5k, out. 
 
original 2013 Well. Lately I've made a point to only review beers I like. This is not that review. If they let me I could do this review in one word ... Mediocre. Or boring, weak, uninspired, average. You choose. Or my choice, Why? Color is uninspiring red. Smells and tastes slightly bitter hops, not very drinkable and rather poor mouthfeel. The good is that I only paid $1.49 and I only got one. Waste of time.",4.18
Flipside Red IPA,"Look is more brown than red and quite murky. Not impressive looking by any stretch. 
 
Smell is very void of much anything. Bottle is exactly 3 months old. Dossappinting here too. 
 
Taste is pretty lackluster. Almost like an arrogsnt bastard ale with only 1/4 of the bitterness.  
 
Feel is sorta oily 
 
Overall I would NOT but this beer again. It came in a mix 12 pack so I have 2 more of them but would much rather them have been one of the other varieties or simply just a SNPA instead.",3.75
Flipside Red IPA,"This is like a better version of arrogant bastard ale to me. It's a thicker more syrupy red ale. It is very well balanced of high dose of malt with hops to balance it out. Flavor is spot on. The alcohol however is not well hidden. I thought this might be 8% alcohol and was surprised to see it is only 6.2%. It has a strong after taste of alcohol going down. I don't mind it though. I wonder though if the label is correct? Caramel flavor is there, darker caramel.",4.55

Pale straw with maybe just a bare impression of haze and a sustained full, thin white cap.

Carbonation is medium, heft is light, and finish is pretty dry and dry grass bitterness. 
 
A peppery note comes out in the nose as it warms, and sweet bread flavor starts to gain on the citrus during this time. The balance works itself into an enjoyable experience by a third of the way down the glass.",3.98

S - Floral up front with lemongrass being prominent, with some time there is a lovely grain , cracker, baguette crust thread. 
As the offering warms a bit there is more noble, grassy spring hops in the nose. 
T - More grainy flavors on the palate, but al in that tight window of crusty bread, cracker, the lemon drp aspect transfers well, and balances out the offering. 
M - Snappy, those hops keep this on the bitter side of the knives edge, with that grain aspect being adding some needed heft. Dry finish pulls you toward another sip

Semi-dry with big hop flavor yet moderate bitterness at first. Matching the smell closely, toasted grains are added to the malt taste, grass and a hint of lemon joins the hops. A white peppery spicy bitterness builds in. The finish is dry, clean, crisp and softens quickly, peppery spice lingers briefly.

Pseudo Sue - Peacharine Dry-Hopped,"Summer never says die now that Toppling Goliath has total access to Peacharine hops. Taking Sue to a place where Sue has never gone before, a more orchard fruit, stone fruit and tropical taste comes from the dry hopping regimen that Pseudo Sue has undertaken  
 
Peacharine Dry Hop SpeudoSue pours with the fresh squeezed, pulpish haze of any New England style pale ale and then crowned with a faint tarnish meringue before casting a fragrant stone fruit spell upon the senses. Striking the nose with the bold perfume of citrus laden scents, softly muddled herb and a bold overcast of stone fruit and the mere scent leaves the mouth salivating. Juicy, sweet and fruity, the malt structures share the light caramel and honey of fructose along with a bready backbone seemingly of shortcake. 
 
As the malts slowly release from the palate, the Peacharine hops roll in with a confident array that starts with mandarin orange, nectarine, apricot and mango along with more citrusy flavors of red grapefruit and lemon. The middle palate soon invites the tangy succulence of pineapple, passionfruit and cantaloup for an extra measure of juiciness. Fresh grass clippings, verbena, softly shaven pine and the fine hemp-like herbalness of chive create a smooth and spicy pectin bitterness that has the tastebuds begging for more. 
 
Like catnip for hopheads, the medium bodied beer trends largely crisp and clean with a malty-dry finish. Its smooth bitterness keeps in keeping with the pale ale style, but its hop-forward attitude has the senses seeing IPA of the highest degree. A medium-long aftertaste of fruit peels, vegetal spice and herb evokes the memories of fruit sweet tea and creamsicle.",4.21

Cracker and toasted wheat bread greets the nose with somewhat mild herbal/floral hops. Bread dough is noticeable with raisin and apple cider. 
 
Neutral taste with above average bitterness, herbal hop flavor is moderate, overall bitterness is on the high side. As in the smell there is malty bread, wheat, cracker and a faint apple cider tartness. Bitterness builds to above average, white peppery with a hint of Cajun spice. Semi-dry at the finish-almost crisp-bitterness last and lingers, peppery and spicy.  
 
Medium-light bodied with lasting, effervescent carbonation. The IPA level bitterness takes away (just a bit) from the balance, can't call this one smooth but close.

Oktoberfest,"12oz bottle purchased from the fridge as a single for $1.99. ""Freshest by 12/03/22"" so this was probably bottled four or five months before that date in either early July or August. If so, then this beer is three to four months old. 
 
Look: Pours a perfectly clear medium copper color. Comes with one-finger of a tan colored head with decent retention. Slow to moderate visual carbonation. 
 
Smell: Nice malt-forward notes of caramel, toffee, dark bread, and honey. Very nice toasty aroma. The finish has a crisp effect with subtle floral and earthy notes from the hops. Subtle notes of fall spices, graham crackers, and dried fruit also. 
 
Taste: It's very balanced and tasty. For 6.1% ABV, it's very easy to drink. The flavors mirror the nose. Up front, it's malty malty malt ball city with earthy undertones. The beer is malty through and through, however the finish is somewhat drying and mildly bitter. I also get lingering semi-sweet chocolate and raisin notes. Before I knew it, my glass was almost empty. Very drinkable and tasty. 
 
Feel: I would say that this is medium bodied, with a slightly chewy mouthfeel and finish. It's a clean beer that is slightly crisp but the maltiness still wants to hang on the palate for a while just to say ""I'm still here and I still love you"". 
 
Overall: I have enjoyed many of Troegs' offerings but I'm pretty sure that this is the first time that I am having their Oktoberfest. I have heard many positive reviews about this beer this season, so I decided to pick it up when I saw it available as a single bottle. I enjoyed this quite a bit. At the same time, with this amount of age on this beer at three to four months old, I don't think that I would want to have more than one or two of these per session. I also wonder how much different this beer tastes when fresher, if much at all. This is a solid Oktoberfest Marzen example that is in-line with the traditional style.

Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,"Now out of all the Oktoberfestbier's  
Out there. This is the world class of them all. Perfect 110/100 !!! 
Just a Perfect beer. Nothing crazy, no additives, just hops,malts,water and yeast. 
HofBrau. 6.3% abv. Not to heavy, not to light, right in the slot. I could easily drink 12 of these no problem. Might need a schnitzel after but no problem. It's not a super "" robust bread crust"" like the darker more American marzens, or super malted to heck. Highly recommend if you see a single, 6 pack, or the popular mini keg.",5
Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,"2023 vintage: 
Appearance: Brilliant pale gold. frothy white head with great retention. Medium carbonation. 
 
Aroma: Floral hops, bready malt 
 
Flavor & aftertaste: Doughy, biscuity malt, spicy hops, moderate to low bitterness. Dry. A little alcohol warming pokes through. 
 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, drying. Moderate length aftertaste. 
 
Overall: First Festbier of 2023 season. This is not quite as good as 2022 and there is a noticeable difference, as I am comparing side by side. It is noticeably lighter and color and has a little less body. Hop aroma is floral with spicy flavor. Malt is more biscuity. Quite dry and alcohol warmth is noticeable. Overall, a good quality Festbier. Very drinkable even at 6.3% abv. 
 
2022 Vintage 
Appearance: Brilliant, deep gold. Frothy white head with great retention. 
 
Aroma: Floral and herbal hops, bready malt. 
 
Flavor and aftertaste: Spicy hops and grainy, bready malt. Restrained bitterness. Semi-dry. Alcohol well hidden. 
 
Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied. Dry at the finish. Medium length finish. 
 
Overall: I found this to be one of the best Festbiers of the season. Simply world class. Complex malt yet very drinkable.",4.61

Oktoberfest,"Great Lakes is a brewery that I am growing to appreciate more and more. I have never been disappointed by any beer of theirs that I have sampled, and their Oktoberfest is no exception. This is a Marzen style beer, that I would assume many US drinkers would associate with the Oktoberfest style. Dark burnt orange in appearance, this beer pours with a rather quickly subsiding head that doesn't leave much lacing. The aroma offers caramel and roasted malt notes that are very inviting. Taste does not disappoint, offering the same malt notes with a pleasant caramel undertone. This is another quality offering from Great Lakes worth seeking out.",3.69

Dark O' The Moon,"Dark bitter chocolate on the nose and at the front of the first sip is nice. Pumpkin is dfinitely the star of the show.

Tucher Festbier,"On tap: 
A moderately hazy pour into a shaker glass didn’t have a lot of head, but decent surface coverage was maintained. Honey lemon tea malt notes greet my nose as I close in on said glass, with a light bit of toasted bread melanoidin. Taste is surprisingly more clean and bitter in comparison. The honey malt is noticeable, but a somewhat piney / lemongrassy bitterness pairs with it and grabs more attention as each sip evolves. Similar to other festbiers I’ve had, the bitter and malt notes play together a little better as the beer gets warmer (or my palate adjusts), improving the overall experience.",3.92
Tucher Festbier,"There was a strong hops aroma as soon as I opened the can. It started out with two fingers of white creamy head, but settled to a thin white layer about halfway through the glass. Carbonation is light compared to most lagers. The body is a little heavy and a little sweet, but it is well balanced by hops. This is very decent festbier at a very reasonable price. The rating of very good is accurate.",3.74

S: Malty, grains, light fruits, a hint of bread dough. 
T: Gently bright fruity hops, caramelized malts, somewhat rich, a hint of apple. It is lightly sweet with a fruity ""bite"" at the top of each drink. 
F: Brisk, bright medium-full body with a smooth middle and a fast, clean, lightly drying finish. It is gently sticky.

Tucher Festbier,"A: Pours a beautifully clear, pale golden/yellow color. A dense white head rises to over two fingers. Excellent retention and plenty of lace left behind as it gently recedes. 
S: Pale malts are the show. Baked sourdough bread, biscuits and honey. This is like walking into a bakery. Just a touch of earthy hops. 
T: Love the pales malts again. Baked bread, biscuits and honey. A bit of an apple cider character. Just enough herbal and grassy hops to make a presence without any real bitterness added.  
M/O: A medium to full body. Wonderful carbonation that is at first crisp, but becomes ultra fine and silky smooth. With the apple cider like character, it does finish a bit sweeter than I would like. Though that is a small gripe, and can drink this all day in big gulps. 
 
This seems like a great traditional Festbeir to me, with lots of character. I hope to see this more often, I think this is the first time I have noticed this on the shelves near me. I'll be getting a lot more.",4.13

Very little bitterness, but the hops add nice floral notes. They work well together here. Highly carbonated, but I’d appreciate a little more body overall. A nice beer for this time of year, though I hope to try the marzen soon.",3.85
Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,,4.07
Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,"Was interested in how the Festbier compared to the Marzen. Honestly, I might prefer this one.  
 
Crystal clear and highly carbonated, though not quite as much as a pilsner. Otherwise is very similar in shade, maybe just a touch darker. Smell is honeyed malt sweetness, crackery pilsner, and a slight hop floral note. Taste offers a surprising amount of fruit. Hint of banana at the beginning, but it quickly overcome by a wine or cider-like dry fruitiness. Pears, apples, and grapes. Breadiness is here on the back of the palate, but it is not the primary note. There is very little toastiness to speak of (perhaps a tiny bit), and I'd say that's the main difference between this and Marzen. Mouthfeel has the carbonation battling the thickness from higher alcohol. A bit undecided (is this supposed to be a heavy or crushable drink?), but not bad. The dry aspect is what really makes it easy to drink, but I can't help but think I'd be sick of it by two anyways. I guess in a sense it needs to cater to both crowds (people who want a strong drink vs people who want a session) if it's the only thing being served at an Oktoberfest though.  
 
Kind of like an imperial Helles. Overall I think I like it about as much as a good Marzen, but this style fits the warmer early autumn weather a lot better. I'll take my Marzen after October.",4.07

The taste is the same with enough spice to produce some bitterness up front, then mellows in the middle with some herbal bite in the finish.  
The body is medium/full, moderate carbonation, fairly smooth.  
Altogether, this is an interesting take on pumpkin beer, I think the stout style adds to the pumpkin, deepens the flavor and rounds it out a bit.",3.89
Dark O' The Moon,"Pours a chocolate brown with a modest two finger head. Aroma is roasted malt and pumpkin, which is mirrored in the taste as well. Cinnamon is very noticeable. Body and mouthfeel are quite light for a stout and low on carbonation. Though pumpkin is present, the roasted malt and, to some extent the cinnamon, seems to make it's presence known a bit more. A different take on the usual pumpkin beer.",3.63
Dark O' The Moon,"Appearance: Deep black in color, with a modest fine-beaded tan head with good persistence. An irregular unbroken ring is formed about the glass wall. 
 
Aroma: Rich notes of cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg vie with dark roasted malt, brown sugar and spicy alcohol. 
 
Taste: The taste opens with pumpkin spices, dark malts, and spicy alcohol, while bitter cocoa vies with brown sugar. Later on, three are cold coffee notes. At the close of the taste, there is a bit of nut flavor, and a lingering, mild earthiness. 
 
Mouth feel: Full, smooth and very soft, with a bit of soft carbonation.  
 
Drinkability/notes: A very well-made example and elegant that brings something new to a familiar style. Certainly this is not a typical choice for April. Nonetheless, I found it quite pleasing.

Double Daisy Cutter - Mosaic,"16oz can purchased from the fridge as a 4-pack for $17.49. Canned on 8/10/2023, so this is just over one month old. 
 
Look: Nice clarity, perhaps a slight chill haze. It is a beautiful rich copper color. This could totally pass for a Festbier. There was a finger and half of off-white head that eventually dissipated to a thin layer. There is a steady stream of very tiny bubbles rising up the circumference of the glass. 
 
Smell: Nice aromas of grapefruit, orange zest, peach gummy rings, mango, melon, papaya, and pineapple. It's also piney and there is a bit of dankness. Even though there are a lot of fruity notes, the nose is balanced and it's not leaning towards fruity or tropical. After swirling the glass, there is a bit of a vegetal note that is oniony. The nose also has a creaminess to it. Nice caramel malt note undertones. 
 
Taste: Wow. This is really good. The taste basically follows the nose - it has all of those flavors coming through in a surprisingly balanced way and the flavors are also intensely delivered. The finish is moderately bitter with tons of orange zest and grapefruit pith on top of a tasty caramel malt backdrop. The finish is not sweet and also not super dry, but definitely leaning towards dry. 
 
Feel: Very nice mouthfeel - it's medium plus bodied with a slightly viscous mouthfeel yet it's very drinkable. The beer has a lingering chewiness. It has very soft, smooth carbonation. 
 
Overall: It's delicious. Of all of the Daisy Cutter versions that I have had (base Pale Ale, Double Daisy Cutter, and Double Daisy Cutter - Nelson), I think that this is by far my favorite. I also love going back to the regular Daisy Cutter Pale Ale, but this is more unique and complex, and obviously it's a bigger beer. I also like how of all the Double Daisy Cutter versions that I have had, this one is most true to the original. I also prefer a West Coast style Imperial IPA to a New England style one, and this beer is definitely West Coast style. As an aside, I love the colorful label design with the ""mosaic"" stained glass depiction of the daisies, which is very clever and appropriate for the Double Daisy Cutter - Mosaic double pale ale. 
 
From instagram: 
Mosaic DDC is built on a similar malt bill as Daisy Cutter, then goes all in on Mosaic hops hand selected in Yakima. This double pale ale leans to the West Coast as the heavy dry hop of Mosaic presents fresh peeled grapefruit & dank blueberry aromas with underlying resin & ripe Allium lingering. A clear, deep golden color lifts a dense billow of white foam. Full bodied with lush mouthfeel, our latest DDC flows with dewy, bright aromas & flavors.

T: green grassy earthiness lighting up front of palate; moderate cider-lemon brightness in the bottom-back of the palate... this morning it's still raining, and this perfectly compliments the aromas... aftertaste dry, vaguely bready, with the nuttiness of a mother... the finish has a lovely length and intensity 
 
F: satiny spread, tingly tang, mineral twinge and parch... wheated bounce up front, sticky funk smearing, acid ting numbing the backs of my teeth, roof of my mouth... my sinuses are opening, view brightening... longing for more goat-licking sticky... textures/body seem broader, more bracing than other brands 
 
O: a travesty I never tried this before; of course, I've hesitated getting their other brands, due to cost, and seeing myself getting carried away... might be my new go-to, when I get that hankering; solid. (2138)",4.47

Oude Geuze,"Fairly clear pour at first, it turned a little hazy as I could not properly leave out some of the stuff at the bottom of the bottle. There isn't much head to talk of, but a thin collar of bubbles shows it isn't a still beer. The nose is my favorite part, with a lemon spritzed tart nectarine impression with an slight cider vinegar edge and some light funky cheese. Combine those more acidic notes with backup scent of light cereal malt and even lighter herbal components. 
 
On the lighter side with the mix of tangy sour and micro-carbonation leavening things. The taste isn't quite as complex as the nose, with a bit more of a herbaceous bitterness than I expected, at least relative to the tartness. The beer has an acidic component that pairs with this, for sure, but on my tongue, it seems to go for the sides while the lightly herbal wood tannin note takes up the middle. As it warms, the sour level slowly increases, pushing the more bitter aspect further back on my palate. 
 
I loved the nose, and my enjoyment of the taste increased as I sipped. Glad to finally get to review this.",4.29
Oude Geuze,"Pours a straw colour. Looks beautiful. Nice head and good lacing is left over as it dissipates. 
 
Smells of barnyard funk and that sort of sourdough yeast that you get on 3 Fonteinen lambics. Lots of fresh fruit character. Apricot, pear, some fresh apple, wet straw. 
 
The oak barrel comes through nicely. Lots of funky fruit notes. Lemon zest, apricot, orange, intangible citrus notes, grape skin. 
 
Medium body with a reeeally long and dry finish. The finish is great.

Superb looking beer. Glowing pale amber body with swarms of carbonation. Big bright white head persists in lesser form throughout leaving a lattice work of lacing. 
 
Slightly funky aroma. 
 
On tasting, not much funk. Dry, sour, tart. The other word that comes to mind is clean, not what you might think of in a gueuze. Such an easy drinker here. A small fruit note. 
 
Mouth above medium, finish a dry sour tartness. 
 
Overall, such a great example of the style, hits all the right notes, subtle, delicate, flavorful, not a bum note anywhere. A bit pricey, so a treat once in a while.",4.32

Minimal, white head. Very slightly milky, medium light orange, amber & golden appearance. Unusual, earthy and almost mildew like aroma, with a spiced and touch of vinegar tinge, as well. Definite lemony and touch of clove, deep down in the depths of the taste, with a light body and tanginess, with a little bit of a medium toasted malt underneath.",3.62

It’s always an honor to drink a Gueuze of any kind, and this one seems to be one of the most popular, at least on BA. This is my first 3 Fonteinen beer since Armand passed, so this one goes out to him. Let’s dive in 
 
Pours a hazy burnt orange with a finger of white head that fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing 
 
The funk in the nose is soft, it really relies more on fleshy fruit than anything else. I’m picking up on aromas of tart peach, jammy apricot, lemon juice, wet hay, white wine, stone, white pepper, light cracker, and apple skin 
 
It’s a bit more forward in taste, and still very damn impressive. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting tart apricot, orange zest, apple skin, white wine vinegar, stone, light leather, and lemon juice. The swallow brings notes of tannic white wine, bready malt, lemon zest, white pepper, stone, wet hay, and jammy apricot 
 
A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a funky and zesty beer. Finishes mostly dry with more earth than tartness 
 
Goddamn, I loved this one. It’s very nuanced but not overly aggressive. Sucks that Lambic has to be so pricey but it’s fun to splurge every now and then",4.43
Oktoberfest,"This one was a bit disappointing to me. This brewery is world class and maybe my expectations were high b/c of that but honestly, I prefer the Sam Adams Oktoberfest to this one. It seemed to be missing some of the toasted malty goodness that i notice in other fest beers but maybe my palate was off that day. I'll give it another shot sometime but it underwhelmed me. A tad too light with the malt and lacking in depth of flavor.",3.54
Oktoberfest,Pours a light copper color with a half finger of head. The nose has mild bready notes. The flavor is crisp and clean without the hearty maltiness that generally accompanies beers of this style. The body is light for the style as well.,3.64

Oktoberfest,"Appearance: Pours a clear, medium amber color. Moderate white head. SRM of 13. (4.25)  
 
Aroma: Moderate aromas of white bread, crackers, yeast. Some hints of honey. (4.00)  
 
Flavor: Moderate flavors of pale malt, crackers, smooth bread. Some toasted bread, flower, and honey. Mildly sweet. Dry finish. (4.00)

Compared to Fair State Festbier 9/2023: Pours darker, milder aromas. More amber notes and smooth, clean mouthfeel. Less rich, toasted, sweet.  
 
Overall: Toppling Goliath has a pretty good Märzen. Amber, toasted with mild flavors. This one is subtle, but excellent. Rich bread, lightly toasted. The aromas and flavors won't impress you initially, but how they subtly linger off the smooth mouthfeel is what makes this one good. Often Märzens are too heavy, boozy, and cloyingly sweet.

Rodenbach Alexander,,4.56
Rodenbach Alexander,"Look: Moderately hazy reddish-brown hue with a thick, cream-colored head with just a hint of pinkish red. Fairly significant lacing and a very slow dissipation to the head. 
 
Smell: It has that red wine-esque aroma that all of the truly great Flanders red ales have. There's a minor hint of fruit, but the aroma is dominated by the ale itself. 
 
Taste: The excellent quality Flanders red ale dominates up-front. Taste of malt, oak, red wine vinegar, plus that distinctive Flanders red taste that is hard to pin down in words. The sour cherry starts to become apparent next, with a lingering sweet cherry on the aftertaste. The lingering sweet cherry is surprising and pushes right up to the edge of being too much like cough syrup, but it never quite crosses the line and gives this a truly unique and distinctive taste. Both the sour and sweet cherry become more apparent as the beer warms. 
 
Feel: fairly highly carbonated, light body overall. 
 
Overall: There's a reason this is a world-class beer. The ale itself is truly top notch, but what pushes this over the edge is the unique blend of sour and sweet cherry that I have never encountered in any other beer I've tried.",4.65

Taste: Lightly sour, sweet, cherry, strawberry, oak, and fruit vinegar. 
 
Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation.

F: Light bodied, smooth and slightly soft, hardens a bit toward the finish, no bite, somewhat chewy. 
O: Good, never gets too sour for my palate and remains easy to drink, seems similar to a Fruit Lambic.",4.15
Rodenbach Alexander,"Rodenbach Alexander pours a reddish/brownish color with lots of bubbles and not much head. The aroma is the tart cherry.

Rodenbach Alexander,"Poured from 330mL bottle into my BeerAdvocate teku. 
 
Appearance: rich amber-ruby hue with a clear body and a thin layer of frothy foam that is perhaps light tan with a hint of pink. Pretty! 
 
Smell: rich aroma with a hint of sourness and wonderful cherry character. It's just sweet enough to be very candylike; I'm super duper into it. 
 
Taste: holy cow, it's even more candylike than the aroma! The extra tartness in the flavor, combined with the sweetness and cherry, give almost a Jolly Rancher like character to this thing. That said, there's definitely malt underneath the candy. Is there such a thing as *too* much candy in a beer like this? I am not sure, but if there is, this might be approaching it. Still -- very good indeed. 
 
Mouthfeel: medium body with a nice carbonation and a good creaminess. It comes together well. 
 
Overall: I mean, this beer is definitely my speed. I love cherry and I love Flemish beers, so really this ticks a lot of boxes for me. It's extremely good, but I want to say it's almost too much even for me. So, excellent, if not transcendent.",4.42
Rodenbach Alexander,"Production date is difficult to decipher - October, 2021? Consumed on 12/30/2022. Poured from a 330mL bottle into my Rodenbach flute. 
 
Cloudy old rose body with auburn highlights and a lasting ivory collar and faint surface slick. Fine sandy lacing; delicate legs. 
 
Fruit forward aroma, fairly vinous (like fine aged balsamic with a hint of blood orange), with a complex sweet graininess.  
 
Intensely juicy palate entry, suffused with pressed cherry juice, orange blossom honey, and an almost savory malt note. Light acidity (more from fruit than lacto), very little oxidation; faint cocoa, plum, vanilla and rosewater. Medium finish with hints of apple and raspberry. Vague hops, diacetyl, and oak, all complimentary to the malt base and ongoing fruit. 
 
Creamy, medium-bodied, sufficiently carbonated.  
 
Was expecting much more acidity (and more tannins), but this is nearly a dessert beer given the prominence of smooth (almost artificial/jolly rancher like) fruit flavor.",4.29

Rodenbach Alexander,"I really like the Rodenbach Caractère Rouge, so I thought I'd give the Rodenbach Alexander a try. 
 
Look – Looks a lot like the Caractère Rouge, with just a bit more head. A beautiful clear amber red with a head that doesn't last very long. 
 
Smell – A nice cherry scent, that isn't overly sour. Also oak and Flanders' funk. This smells really nice!  
 
Taste – The taste is very much like the smell. Not sour at all. In fact, this is the first sour that I think could use just a bit more sourness, though I much prefer this to overly sour sours. A bit dry, but very good. 
 
Feel – A nice carbonation. Very easy to drink. 
 
Overall – This is another great beer from Rodenbach. I'm generally not a huge fan of this style of beer because it's usually too sour for my liking, but this one is nice.",4.68

Smells of musky oak, apple cider vinegar, dusty cellar, and balsamic. 
 
The taste follows the nose, but is a balance of puckering sour and sweetness. Cherries are in there as well. 
 
Thick and acidic, somewhat woody texture with moderate to low carbonation. 
 
I got this a long time ago, somewhere in North America, probably the USA, likely California. Brought it to Phuket with me over 18 months ago, where I’m drinking during our second Covid quarantine, June 21st, 2022. Great brew, survived a lot, but not this time of isolation!",4.5

Bourbon Barrel-Aged Barley Wine,2017 vintage. Enjoyed on 05/14/2022,4.09
Bourbon Barrel-Aged Barley Wine,"2018 vintage; consumed on 1/11/22 
 
Pours a clear jet-crimson body with sharp, blood-red highlights and topped with a finger and a half of creamy, pale beige foam; sub-par head retention fades to a few spotty, paper-thin islands of cap, a large, frothy collar, and no lacing clinging to the walls of the glass. 
 
Aromas of harsh, ripe whiskey breed burnt sugar, smoked butterscotch and caramel, and a decadent prune/plum compote; shreds of whiskey umami and soy varnish make way for floral oak barrel carrying vanilla icing against potent bourbon lingering as a final impressor. 
 
Taste shows burnt sugar and toffee swirled into fig syrup upfront, with plummy esters lingering through the mid-palate to a bourbon back end, leaving a dusting of cocoa to finish. 
 
Mouthfeel offers a medium body with minimal carbonation and a semi-oily viscosity, maintaining a slickness into the mid-palate; a char is intertwined in a mild, tannic twang with incredible subtlety on the back end of the palate, where a piercing, encompassing warmth peaks into the finish. 
 
Cresting at the potent richness of boozy barrel peaks, ascendant dark fruit jams near umami status against an unrelenting spirit and fresh oak barrel interplay; structure and detail at the highest levels of barleywine.",4.25

Bottle marked on back label “Shelf Life – Unlimited” also “PKG 11/17/2021). Served at 53.8 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 57.3 degrees.  
Appearance – 3. 
First pour – Brown (SRM 20), nearly opaque. 
Body - Ruby Brown (SRM 24), opaque. Under direct light, same. When rear lite, opaque but some light penetrates the edges – ruby. 
Head – Small (Maximum 0.7 cm, aggressive center pour), camel, high density, quickly diminishing to a 0.15 cm crown with a thin, partial cap.  
Lacing – None. 
Aroma – 4.5 – Chocolate and bourbon edge out roasted malt as the dominant aromas, no hops, no yeast. 
Flavor – 4.5 – Flavor follows the nose – roasted malt, slightly bitter, no hops, no yeast. No ethanol (13.4 % ABV as marked on label) aroma or taste. Marked gastric warming occurs. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl.  
Palate – 4.5 – Medium, creamy, soft but lively carbonation.

Pours out to a syrupy thick ink black, forming a thick dark cocoa head with average retention, sparse lacing. The nose is definitely full of bourbon but on top of that classic expedition nose we all love...prunes, dark chocolate, raisins, figs, soy sauce and black walnut. Mouthfeel is smooth and syrupy, dense bodied. Medium light carbonation, ~2.25 carbs or so. Taste is a recap of the nose. The bourbon is well balanced with the other complex stuff going on here and gives it a more warming presence that traditional Expedition. Bitterness is mild and earthy, hops are kept in check by copious malts. Considering the rich complex malts, there is no sourness or astringency here...this easily happens in lesser RIS's if the roasted malts are overdone. One is enough. It's a heavy hitter and very rich.

Temptation,"Had this right after PtY, been wanting to try this almost as long as Pliny. Certainly one of the top sours I haven’t been able to try. Fathom Bistro & Bar on Shelter Island, San Diego. So much funk and delicious barrel character. The definition of a sour blonde. Wayyyy to easy to drink. Wow!",4.76
Temptation,"Golden color, nicely hazy, with a fizzy white head that dissipates quickly. The nose is green grape, lemon, oak, and da funky Brett. 
 
The taste is very refined, with the green grape and funky Brett up front and the oak and lemon at the back of the palate, with a lingering flavor profile that is delicious.  
 
The mouthfeel is bright and fizzy, per the style. An excellent wild ale, IMHO.",4.46

Oude Geuze,"A 750ml corked and caged bottle, blend°63, season 18/19, bottled on 3rd April 2019. Served from a 3 Fonteinen lambic basket, and poured into a 3 Fonteinen gueuze glass. 
 
Appearance: A nice clear golden colour with a just over one finger white head that had decent retention while leaving some nice lacing. 
 
Aroma: Lightly tart, barnyard, funky, oak, hay, green apple, with light lemon notes. 
 
Taste: Sour, tart, funk, oak, hay, green apple, lime, lemon, with light notes of grape skin. 
 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with high, lively carbonation. 
 
Overall: Surprised I didn’t review this much earlier. For an Oude Geuze in the core range, this is right up there among the best in my opinion, along with 3F A&G and Tilquin Oude Gueuze. I also specifically picked blend°63 of season 18/19, because it’s been one of my favourites lately, since the paper label blends of 2015 and earlier. It’s just super easy and enjoyable to drink, it’s basically something I could down at all hours of the day.",4.5

Oktoberfest,"I’m a huge Oktoberfest fan and I really look forward to this time of year. When I was walking through the beer store today I was looking for a Sam Adam but it’s not out yet. So looking around they had a few and I wanted to try something new, so I grab this one over Bells. I liked the beer but I don’t think it’s it’s an Oktoberfest, its just doesn’t have that Malt feel and it’s a little thin. Solid lager but not what I was looking for today.",3.63
Oktoberfest,"From a 16 oz can packed on 7/11/23 consumed on 8/12/23 
 
Clear pouring beer from the can, and copper colored. When I hold it to the light, I see a few carbonation bubbles rising in the glass. The head that formed was minimal, less than one finger, and off white. The head isn't long lasting, and there's no lacing on the glass as it dissipates to a ring around the glass.  
The aroma is just screaming biscuit and uncooked bread to me. So malty. Notes of caramel also hit my nose, but faint.  
Taste - The flavor isn't as malty as I was expecting from the aroma. It seems somewhat crisp up front with more of the malts on the back. They just don't jump out as much as I expected. There's actually more hops than I expect from this styler, and they produce a bitterness on the back that just doesn't seem to work for the style.  
The body is decent for the style.  
Not too sure about this one. It's not bad tasting, though, the hop bitterness that I'm getting just doesn't seem right for the style.",3.39
Oktoberfest,"Pours a beautiful clear golden copper with a thick ivory head that leaves spotty lacing. Aroma is caramel malt, rye bread and some floral hops. Flavor follows the nose, sweet up front with minimal floral hops in the finish. Feel is medium bodied with ample carbonation. Overall, another nice beer from these folks.",3.94
Oktoberfest,"16oz can. Date stamp on can bottom is 'PKG07/11/23'. 
Mostly clear, deep gold colored body. Two fingers of dirty white head. This transforms to a scuzzy cap and ring. Leaves behind partial webs of lacing. 
Aroma is very much of bread, seems to be a mix of sourdough, sweet bread, and dark bread. 
Taste is quite sweet but very malty. Toasted bread, sourdough, home made whole grain bread, and dark bread. Has a touch of floral hops. All continue into the aftertaste. 
Full mouth feel. Clean and crisp finish. Good carbonation. 
Lots of bread flavors and an easy to drink feel. A meal in a can.",4

Darkness,"2022 vintage: 
 
Poured from a 16 ounce can dated 9/28/22 into a snifter. 
 
Look- Black, opaque, medium brown frothy head, above average head retention and lacing. 
 
Smell- Toasted oats, cacao, toffee, medium strength of scent. 
 
Taste- Coffee, cacao, cherry, mildly sweet, high strength of flavor. 
 
Feel- Between medium and full body, average carbonation, moderately bitter, mildly sweet, moderately mouth coating, moderately mouth warming. 
 
Overall- Black with medium brown frothy head and above average head retention and lacing. Bouquet was medium in strength and dominated by toasted oats with notes of cacao and toffee. Taste was high in strength and a superbly balanced mix of coffee, cacao and cherry. Feel was between medium and full body with moderate mouth warming and moderate coating properties.

Darkness,"Traded for this ages ago, probably from ShogoKawada, thanks whoever it was! 2008 vintage. Enjoyed on 3/3/23. Poured from a 750mL waxed and capped bottled into a snifter. Served lightly chilled. 
 
Impenetrable seal brown liquid with a lasting dun collar. Fine lacing; thick viscous legs. Surprisingly good retention.  
 
Molasses, chocolate covered cherries, medium-roast coffee, maple candy, and complex malt in the nose.  
 
Stale coffee, milk chocolate, weak tobacco, and brown sugar on the palate. Low bitterness, faint grapefruit, but the hops have faded. Flavors are good but a bit flat, though there are few other signs of oxidation. Medium finish with malt balls, loam, and plum pudding. 
 
Medium-full bodied, creamy, with decent carbonation. ABV is well integrated.

Darkness,"2016 Vintage served at 52 degrees.  
 
While the color of this beer is like pretty much every other stout, what stands out is the glorious, thick and persistent dark tan colored head. Beautiful looking consistency and excellent lacing. Rare for me to think of a stout as anything above a 3.75, but this is getting a 4.5  
 
Nose isn't up to the same level as the look, but it's still really nice, highlighted by loads of chocolate, toffee and faint roast. Taste largely follows, but with much more roast & coffee. Body is not quite as hefty as I anticipated. I want to say it's light, but it also feels like a milkshake, and those two things don't seem to make sense together, so I'm not sure how to describe it. Regardless, this is quite tasty. Glad I finally cracked it open.",4.06

Darkness,"(bomber, black-waxed, Darkness 2020; purchased off shelf at Shangy's last week... poured into my Trillium fat tulip) 
 
L: tight, creamy dark tan foam; dark brown liquid, bordering on black, opaque... head recedes into a splotchy cap and smeared collar, but it laces lots in jagged, fingery-flecked bands 
 
S: mint and espresso overtones; bittersweet dark chocolate... slowly emerging hints of roasted grains, alcohol, Irish Cream qualities... a few beats later, charred and deeply toasted, caramelized grain... kind of an overall typical RIS aroma profile; tonic, outdoorsy top notes; perhaps short of cinematic in scope, but nonetheless invigorating 
 
T: big burst of bold flavors: espresso, toffee, molasses cookie... sweetish, roasty, residual underbelly and lightly campfiery, roasted nutty overtones in the aftertaste; big burp after a minute brings up sweetish, sooty dark chocolate... second big sip, more of a rounded malt character, with the interplay, contrast, and divide of heavy roast and rich crystal malts more stark; still little booziness, but some delicate spicy phenols and dark dried fruit notes starting to surface, and not long after some subtle black licorice... hop herbality finally opens up, rising above the burnt bliss of sugars below 
 
F: cooling quality to its aromatics... slick velvet texture... lithe levity despite its luscious lines... medium-full bodied, bordering on the latter... malt milk, attenuated and accentuated by the balance of booze; dark nog, rib-sticking... maybe it's the 2 years on this, but it's heaven to my senses 
 
O: not the most nuanced, but a pretty darn solid RIS... its sweetness is a touch more redolent than most style examples but luckily the roasted barley and hop bitterness are as intense, lending some needed balance... as expected, its high marks are likely because of its relative unavailability; this was the first time (along with Abrasive) that I've encountered it out this way, so I was easily compelled to buy a bottle (2086)",4.54
Darkness,,4.08
Darkness,This beer is dark but not dark like used motor oil. Smells of roasted coffee. This is one beer where you definitely have to let sit out for awhile to really taste it. Has a strong malt taste and not boozy at all.,4.6
Darkness,"2021 vintage 
 
I’ve been sitting on this one for a minute now and I’m excited to finally try it. An absolute classic RIS, and one that totally caught me off guard when I saw it at the store, just sitting on the shelf. This is also my first beer from Surly so I’m even more hyped. Let’s tackle this massive beast 
 
Pours a very dark brown with a finger of tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing 
 
There’s still a solid bitterness to this for being 2 years old which is quite surprising to me. I’m picking up on aromas of leafy hops, burnt caramel, molasses, dark chocolate, charred wood, dark roast coffee, light vanilla, and red grape 
 
While still bitter in taste, it feels like it’s integrated much better than the nose. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting red grape, cocoa powder, charred malt, caramel, vanilla bean, black cherry, sweetened coffee, light earthy hops, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of res grape, black cherry, molasses, milk chocolate, light roast coffee, leafy hops, vanilla bean, sweet caramel, and charred malt 
 
A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick and lightly boozy beer. Finishes a tad sticky but dries out over time 
 
Oh yeah, this is really good. Warm and complex, it develops over the course of the drink. I’ll have to try other vintages",4.34
Darkness,,4.77
Darkness,"Straight 5s. Sublime is my word for 2023 and it applies here. Labeled a RIS, this is not the traditional version. While high in abv and pitch black, it is super creamy and loaded with underlying tones of dark dried fruit like prunes, figs, or dates, and subtle hints of cocoa and coffee. I am not suggesting they are added, but they are present in the flavor profile. This stout is truly remarkable and I am so happy it is available locally (PA) for the first time in forever.",5
Darkness,"Canned 10/19/22, enjoyed 1/9/23 
Poured pitch black, very slowly as the tan head was quite aggressive. Lots of lacing left as I sipped it down. 
The aroma, even to my damaged nose was dark fruit and caramelized sugar and roasted malts.  
The taste was all that and more, the flavor just kept coming. The front was the sweet part and the middle the savory with the swallow bringing in the hops to keep it from going all mushy. 
The feel was spot on, a very nice sipper and just overall an excellent RIS.",4.6

Gueuze 100% Lambic,"Bottled 10/5/21 
 
This is Cantillon’s most popular beer, and I’m somehow only getting to it now. I was originally intending to just buy another bottle of Fou Foune from MBC, but when I saw the seller had this one available for a good price I figured I had to get it. Let’s pop it open and see what it has to offer 
 
Pours a cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of soapy off white head that quickly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing 
 
There's a lot of funk in the nose here, but it's very well integrated. i'm picking up on aromas of wet hay, sharp oak, lemon zest, wildflower honey, crabapple, white wine vinegar, white pepper, light cracker, and pear 
 
The funk is certainly more aggressive in taste, though it's more than welcome here. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting lemon juice, earthy wheat, sharp oak, white wine vinegar, crabapple, pear skin, wet hay, jammy apricot, and white pepper. The swallow brings notes of lemon juice, wildflower honey, crabapple, sharp oak, white wine vinegar, pear skin, jammy apricot, earthy wheat, tobacco, light cracker, and a touch of smoke 
 
A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a sharp yet slick beer. Finishes oddly sticky but eventually dries out 
 
This is wonderful, but I'm honestly a bit surprised that it's not super dry. The sticky finish takes away from the experience a bit, but overall it's still a great expereince",4.33
Hommage,"375ml green bottle. Corked and caged. Label has the bottling date as '07/01/2020' and good until '10/26/2040'. 
Final dregs clouded up the dark cherry red body. Brief fizzy head but rising bubbles keep trying to form a ring. No lacing. 
Aroma of raspberry, cherry, oak funk, and a little barley and wheat grain. 
Taste is tart with raspberry, cherry, and oak funk. Some level of sweetness too. Underlay of barley and wheat malt. Quick exit in the aftertaste. 
Medium mouth feel, with a bit of nectar. Drying finish, and some tooth scraping (acidic). Supportive carbonation. 
The oak aging has resulted in an excellent blend of raspberry and cherry, along with the fermented malts. All exist on a naturally higher plane.",4.47

Samuel Adams Utopias,"2017 vintage - shared with me from a friend. Small 2oz pour for each of us. Served in a small 4oz snifter tasting glass. 
 
Appearance: Clear dark amber-copper color. No lacing (there wouldn't be at this ABV).  
 
Smell: Boozy - bourbon barrel notes, honey, toffee. Rich.  
 
Taste: Lots going on. Definitely some barleywine notes, with some bourbon, oak, vanilla, toffee, honey, orange, raisin, and some bitter notes at the finish as well.  
 
Mouthfeel: Surprisingly smooth for something this high in alcohol. Good thickness, no carbonation, dry finish, and only a little warming.  
 
Overall / Drinkability: I can see why some people describe this a more like a brandy than a beer, and I almost want to call it a Barleybrandy. It's got aspects of a Barleywine, but so much more. Glad I got a taste of it. Not sure I could finish a large glass of this though - definitely a slow sipping and savoring beer. Unique and quite tasty.",4.45

Beautiful cogn/armagnac notes are most prominent but there is room for plenty more. Smokey wood and tobacco, raisin/plum schnapps?, plenty of brown liquor, hints of vanilla and honey, plus...just so much more. The body is wonderfully sticky and viscous.

Flavor follows, with deep caramel malt, dried dark fruit, particularly dates and raisins, brown bread and cloves. Finishes a bit minierally but with residual dark fruit. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. Has a much brighter flavor profile than any dubbel I've had before, almost a Belgian dark ale flavor. This is undoubtedly due to this having a bit of age to it with a best buy date of 2019, so likely about 8 years old. Probably my only chance to try this, so I grabbed a bottle. Despite the assumed lighter characater for aging, has a deep malt and great fruit notes. A slight sharpness (mineral) in the finish, but the residual fruit flavors make up for it. This makes me really want to try a fresher bottle, but I'm still impressed with the malty flavor depth of the 8; not quite a deep and malty as 12, but fine.

The flavor was really, really good. Dark fruit and dark chocolate and a menagerie of spices that were all wrapped up in what seemed like champagne flavors and texture. 
The feel was excellent, the massive head didn’t dissipate the carbonation that I could tell and somehow that is what made it all work together. Maybe the bite of the bubbles kept it from getting too sweet? Not sure. But darned good dubbel!",4.53

Well, it may be a bit older than is ideal, but I’m very excited to try Westy 8, the highest rated Dubbel on BA! After having the 12 for the first time just a few weeks ago and loving it, I knew I had to seek out some of this too. I managed to end up with 1 bottle each of 2010 and 2011, so I figured I’d drink the slightly newer one first. Let’s see what it’s all about 
 
Pours an opaque medium brown with just a ring of light tan bubbles that leaves no lacing 
 
There’s a surprising boozy bite in the nose here given it’s only 8%. I’m picking up on aromas of dark bread, burnt caramel, sweet bourbon, raisin, brown sugar, honey, pear skin, and light clove 
 
Even 11 years out, this has a great presence in taste. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting black cherry, dark bread, candi sugar, pear skin, light floral hops, overripe banana, and plum. The swallow brings notes of dark toast, raisin, red grape, sweet caramel, toffee, sticky molasses, and light honey 
 
A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth and silky beer. Finishes mostly dry with a nice fruity sweetness 
 
It’s certainly not the ideal to have this so old, so I have to bump it a bit in the overall. I can see what used to be there when it was fresh and I hope one day to be able to try it fresh. Either way, it’s an awesome beer",4.28

Pours a dark purplish red with a small to nonexistent head -- a thin white ring around the glass, with sparse carbonation. Fairly hazy. Smell is rich berry jam and oaky acid tartness. 
 
Taste is similar -- rich berry jam, more on the oak and less on the acid, almost a funk to it, and something that hints at a butteriness, not diacetyl, but something that just makes it seem fuller and richer. Moderate fruit skin bitterness characteristic.

Gueuze 100% Lambic,"2,500th review! It's only been 9.5 years. Super excited to try this legendary Cantillon as I've been sitting on it for a few months hoping for a milestone brew. 2021 bottling and purchased from Durand for a small but worthwhile fortune. My first Loon. Served cold into a goblet. 
 
Appearance - Picturesque bright golden color with a small amount of haze. A finger of small soapy cap that continues to fizzle on as more head forms from the bubbles rising in the glass. 
 
Smell - Tartness with subtle bits of cherry, apple skins, woody and slightly musty barrel, some earthy funk. There's sort of a deep underlying sweetness there too that ties all the aromas together. 
 
Taste - A little sourness and green apple tartness. Elements of wood and musty barrel. Light grapey qualities too. Funky without being too far out in left field. Cohesive in the flavors. A slightly spicy element in the aftermath maybe. As it warms the woody barrel note seems to be elevated with a trace of honey. Depth of flavor is awesome and lingers on really well in the aftertaste, 
 
Mouthfeel - Medium-light body, good expressive carbonation and very dry finish. 
 
Overall - Awesome sour beer, the depth is unreal and it's difficult to decipher everything you're tasting. Super stoked to have finally tried this and boy does it ever live up to expectations.

Gueuze 100% Lambic,"September 2021 bottle. 
 
Looks: Slightly cloudy orange/gold, no head or legs. 
 
Smells: Sour and funky, lots of fruit for an unfruited lambic (bacteria are amazing, hey?). I get apricot, orange zest, citron, green apple, pineapple, wood, a bit of bread, and apple cider vinegar levels of fermentation.  
 
Tastes: Similar to the nose but less fruity, mostly apricot, citrus, and green apple plus the woodiness and bready malt, with the sourness and funk being more prominent. Gave me a big initial pucker but was smooth after.  
 
Feels: Nice medium body, a slight fuzzy carbonation that doesn't linger very long. 
 
Overall: Heck yeah. Awesome gueuze, lives up to the Cantillon hype even if it's not mind-blowing.",4.49
Gueuze 100% Lambic,"A 750ml corked and capped bottle, 20/21 season, bottled on 1st October 2020. Poured into a 3 Fonteinen gueuze glass. 
 
Appearance: A mostly clear golden orange colour with a big two finger white head that had pretty good retention and eventually settled to a thin cap while leaving some nice lacing. 
 
Aroma: Sour, tart, funky, musty, wet wood, green apple, grapefruit zest, with a touch of white grapes. 
 
Taste: Sour, tart, slightly sweet, funky, oak, apricot, with some light lemon zesty notes. 
 
Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. 
 
Overall: A nice enjoyable easy to drink gueuze. Perfect for a hot summer day.",4.34
Gueuze 100% Lambic,"Smell of tart cherries and some yeasty bread. Orange-ish pour with visible active carbonation. Flavor is tart but nothing like the kettle sours of today. More balanced, and smooth enough to allow for the fruit notes to come through. This is surprisingly mellow in the finish, with the bready notes of the yeast taking hold. 
 
My first Cantillon offering, and shared with a couple friends at Monk's Cafe in Philly. Absolutely a must try for any beer enthusiast.",4.42

Gueuze 100% Lambic,,5
Gueuze 100% Lambic,"Rich gold body is almost copper, clear and shining, forming a fine fizzy head, off white and holding retention for a little over a minute before dwindling to a thin layer. 
Aroma is lightly tart and fruity like white grapes, wheat, honey. 
Fresh, bright, and light - feels like summer in an orchard; reminiscent of spanish sidre, with flavours of crisp sweet/tart apples and hay, with a whisper of funk, a light lactic tang, the freshest mountain water, oak; it's the perfect level of sourness, enough to make you smack your lips, but not pucker; the finish is dry and flavour lingers; the feel is prickly and finely effervescent, medium bodied, crisp yet silky. 
 
Beautiful in it's simplicity and refinement. Not particularly complex, it is pure and deftly crafted, and approachable.",4.41

Hommage,"A: Pours purple/blood red color. A small pink/white head forms initially. Though that recedes quickly with little lace. That color is really stunning though. 
S: Aromatic and tart berries and cherries up front and center. With an unmistakable earthy funk. There is a bit of oak and vanilla here as well. A really pungent and sharp aroma that I enjoy. 
T: Oh boy, that sweet tart berry/cherry mix is there. Which becomes super acidic and sour. That funk, light oak and vanilla is there as well. Which tries to help balance. Though that acidic sourness becomes a little to much and makes this unbalanced for me. 
M/O: A medium body that has a nice crisp bite. Really well carbonated. Definitely some sweetness as would be expected, but finishes with a dry bite as well. Pretty classic for the style, but still its slow going. That acidity takes over to much. 
 
I love 3 Fonteinen, and this is a good example of the style for sure. Though it is unbalanced for me. There are other Fruit Lambic's that I prefer over this, but still you have to acknowledge that this is exactly what they wanted to make, and I do enjoy it. Just not love it as much as others in the style, or even others from this same brewery. I would recommend this, if you enjoy intense flavors, especially sour acidic cherries.",3.7

Leffe Blonde,"11.2 ounce bottle poured into (ahem.,.) an opaque plastic cup at a French bistro in Aventura Mall in Florida. ‘Best by May, 2024’, so it’s fresh. 6.6% ABV. 
Big ole thick creamy head pops up and crowns.  
Aroma of familiar Belgian yeast, mild clove, little perfumey.. 
Taste is pretty spot on for a Belgian blond. Herbs, clove, touch of banana, light malt, a vanilla note, tad of bitter.

Smells of wet wood, cardamom and unripe, green banana among notes of allspice and dried grass. 
 
Has a light body with a well accentuated, higher carbonation level, revealing a mineralic quality, leading to a well working refreshment. 
 
Tastes of honey, melting toffee and rustic grains among soothing bread dough and a faint note of dry leaves. Offers a sprizzy middle part, with the beer‘s carbonation becoming more prominent, together a sweet, rock sugar malt backbone. Finishes with a mineralic burst, more honey and a prevailing maltiness.

Leffe Blonde,"Re-reviewing as it was a long time since I reviewed this...will review the brune next...cool bottle design, used to drink this a lot in the past, and it was one of my favorite beers, though these were the days of being brought up surrounded by lagers and Diamond White...so this was my first taste of a real beer.  
 
Aside from Stella, this must be the 2nd most mass produced beer from Belgium I think. I used to drink it lots in Australia...as Australian beers are usually pretty terrible. 
 
Good creamy froth that stays in the glass. Some quite large bubbles. Aroma is banana and cloves.  
 
Flavour has elements of soy sauce, haha I always thought this. There is a herbiness coming through, and elements of orange peel, cloves, lemon peel, and more soy sauce. It's not as complex as the best Belgian beers, but considering this is mass produced by Inbev, it's still pretty good. But it lacks the mouth feel and complexity of an unpasteurized trappist ale. According to the bottle it contains added vanilla also. Now that I have read this, I can taste a little vanilla ; ) But banana is more noticeable, there is a little vanilla in the aftertaste. 
 
The taste isn't particularly smooth...it's kind of angry and chaotic...and it tastes like it contains more alcohol than it actually does. A Westervelen 12 or Rochefort 10 both taste like they contain less alcohol than this. 
 
Very good, but not quite great. Happy to drink this again, though from memory, sometimes the bottles actually go bad before you drink them, so be careful. Or maybe this was just my dad's cellar. The flavour is a bit too soy saucy for me, though still one of the best mass produced beers out there for sure.  
 
Ok, onwards to the brune '; )",3.46

Leffe Blonde,"This was my favourite beer of all time for over 10yrs, unfortunately the rights were sold to a Brazilian brewer who immediately set about destroying it! It's been dropped from 6.6% to 6.0% and the original flavour is a past memory, tastes of very little but a revolting metallic after taste and it's also now heavily carbonated, and holds no head whatsoever.  
 
This is headed for 4.5% and in the gutter with pissy Heineken etc! I kind of knew it was going bad the moment they switched from corks to metal caps on the 750ml btls, a few years later they've proved me right!  
 
Some of the home keg sellers still have 6.6% kegs, my advice is to snap them up, they're the last of the original. 
 
Absolute shame that this once fantastic beer has been sold out!",1
Leffe Blonde,"330ml. bottle in Vientiane, Laos. Pours a clear light amber. Aroma of malt, light hops clove and sweet fruits.Light acidity, lightly bitter. Medium body, watery texture, moderate carbonation. A good Belgian ale, deserving of its popularity.",4.15
Leffe Blonde,"Poured from a 330ml bottle . 6% . 
 
Not sure what's going on with the lower abv , brewed for UK market perhaps? 
Pours a dark amber , very bubbly and a large bubbled , off white head. The smell is Belgian yeast and vague honey and the taste follows on with a slight added fruitiness. 
The mouthfeel is too syrupy, not awful but not good. Overall, this isn't as good as it used to be BUT maybe it would be if I got the 6.6% beer. This feels like a dumbing down of a previously much better beer though. Disappointed.",3.55
Leffe Blonde,"It's not bad for the price, but it is not in the same league as a great Belgian blonde like Delirium Tremens. The BA score of 81 is generous. It lacks crispness and finishes a little too sweet. The body is light but it retains a head and creates good lacing. Heavy hops are not expected in this style, but it could use more bitterness.

Usually I don't review old beers, but the 12 pack was refrigerated at the store most of its life, and frankly, most Alesmith is pretty old around here, so it serves as a valid review in my opinion.

Lightly foggy orange-amber--just about as hazy as Hazy Nosh, ironically enough--with a moderately short off-white head leaving substantial but fluid lacing that falls back down to the surface in slo-mo. 
 
A solid West Coast IPA with plenty of citrus and pine working in concert, it's quite a bit more bitter and dank than their hazy, obviously, but without all that limey juiciness, instead exhibiting some catty hints in the exhale. However, it's quite clean up front, and stunningly reminds me of the sort of prickly resins often found in Fat Head's stellar IPA program, although paired with a lesser hint of dampening graham.

the beer pours a murky light copper color with a ton of floaties. Kind of surprised after reading so many reviews describing the color as a clear copper color... about three fingers worth of rocky white head with substantial lacing. 
 
Lots of citrus fruits in the aroma, as well as some pineapple, mango, and papaya. Mildly bready and earthy malts balance out the hopiness.  
 
Like the aroma the flavor is orange, papaya, mango, with a nice bready, toasty malt character. Great balance. Medium bodied and slick on the tounge. A bit heavier than most IPA's, definitely a well balanced beer more in line with the east coast IPA style, but with the big citrusy hop punch of a west coast IPA

Prunes, cherries, and port are forward on the palate. Vinous quality persists with a background of dark malt, black licorice, and faint chocolate. Blackberries, violets, dulce de leche, ash, clay, and figs. Some oxidation is leading this into Old Ale territory, but no cardboard or other off notes. Low bitterness, medium-sweet, linear finish.

Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,"This is a tame IPA, but I like it well enough. I'd be happy to drink it a party at which I didn't pay for it. :) Haha! That's not a bash, it's just a very inoffensive and NOT rebellious form of the style that has a more pronounced malt profile and a balanced and tame hope bite. 
 
Sure, if you are not an IPA drinker you may notice what might be perceived as a strong hop presence, giving it the typical citrus and pine notes. It does pour a golden color with a frothy head, creating an inviting appearance so there's also that...put it in a glass and church it up baby!!  
 
The standout features of this beer is its balance. Despite the high hop content, it manages to maintain a smooth and drinkable flavor that I think makes it very middling in the true sense of the word, but not necessarily in a bad way.  
 
The bitterness is well-matched with a malty sweetness, creating a harmonious flavor profile. This beer is perfect for those who enjoy a strong and hoppy IPA without overpowering the senses 
 
A brewery that made it's name NOT making hoppy beers has made one that I think is aligned with their overall portfolio. I can appreciate this as their IPA, not THE prototypical American or WC IPA, this is a Sam Adams IPA and it's good!",3.33

Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,"Poured a couple of brown 12 oz. bottles into a singular clear glass liter mug for observation. It's a light bright copper color, with emphasis on light. Rather translucent more than colorful, maybe the head and lacing will compensate. No, there's little of either there. The lacing outperforms, but not by much. It's not aromatic, neither. OK, now for the taste, the big category. Unfortunately, nothing to rave about here. It's pretty good; well balanced between a noticeable malt backbone, which is more earthy than sweet (good) and a hoppy finish. The body is a little thin and the hops aren't bitter enough, but they're there. If ever there was an IPA intended to be mass produced to offend the least number of drinkers, this is it. Not at all rebellious, it conforms to the basic norms of a mainstream beer with a hint of a style above the standard American lager. Likely the best choice at national chain restaurants.",3.63
Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,"12/11/14: 
Appearance: clear, bright golden hue, long-lasting, bone white head, looking good. 
 
Aroma: Fresh and lively hop aromatics, screaming with citrus and tropical fruits, bristling with pine and grass. Green as it gets. 
 
Taste: Brisk hop bite at the front, soft and mellow from there on out. Light bodied, but with a long, bitter hop finish. Exquisite drinkability, but for hop-heads only. Bitter hop resins lay long on the palate, providing more than sufficient refreshment for those of us who crave the alpha acids. 
 
A very nice rendition of this popular style, but it's not just not landing on the top tier, I'm afraid. A few steps short. 
 
Wait. I just noticed something. The box reads: ""Enjoy before Dec. 2014."" No specific date given. This was purchased in early December 2014. I always see a lot of these cases at the store I bought it at, I'm guessing it's not that popular, for whatever reason. Maybe if I'd bought it earlier, it would taste fresher, and I'd see higher up on that tier…maybe...

I have to say it tastes nothing like the cans or bottles sold in the US. This beer has no equal in taste, mouth feel, and character. It made me change the way I see lagers. This beer is rich, with nuanced flavor that changes from the sweet moment the solid white foam touches your lips, through the hop bitterness that hits you at the back of your tongue, to the floral accents felt in your nose when exhaling. It felt like a snack when just drinking it at a bar, and like another dish when having it with a meal.

F: Moderate carbonation, noticeable warmth.  
O: This tastes old, and not in an old bottle way, in an old recipe way. I don’t know how else to describe it. The esters and malt are so nicely balanced, and not overwhelming. It’s gentle for the style, and all the better for it.",4.33
Tripel Karmeliet,"I don't know what I've been doing but it's definitely fucking around because this is genuinely my first time having this one, and yet again in Brussels it of course comes in proper glassware! 
 
The head is active as hell, so there you can already see how perfectly designed the glass is because it contains it top to bottom, while the body is a sparklingly clear wedding band gold. 
 
Taste is more floral than I expect out of a tripel, which is unique to me, while still featuring some gently peppery phenols as well as some citrus peel and a touch of minerality. It's actually more beautifully bright of fruity characteristics like stonefruit, but also honeysuckle. It's incredible. 
 
Tripel Karmeliet is one of most wonderfully expressive tripels I've ever had, and I regret not having had one of these ages ago. This could have changed my perspective of Belgian ales so drastically, and so much sooner. Hands down this is the best tripel on Earth.",4.52

Head Hunter,"12oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for $2.99 plus tax. Canned on 05/15/23, so this beer is almost three months old. 
 
Look: It has a nice orange gold color with a half finger of beige colored head. The beer is fairly clear, however it is unfiltered and there is a slight haziness / chill haze. 
 
Smell: Lots of resinous pine and citrus (grapefruit and orange) notes. Also dried pineapple. This smells really nice, I wouldn't mind wearing fragrance that smelled like this. There's a subtle darker biscuit malt underneath all of the hops. Spicy notes along with some paint thinner. Subtle green bell pepper on the finish. More fruitiness comes through on the nose as I get into it and as the beer warms up. I ultimately get a nice, sweet cantaloupe note along with lots of orange zest. 
 
Taste: Ooooh, this is seriously intense! They weren't kidding when they said ""aggressively hopped West-Coast IPA""! It has a bit of that enamel-stripping character that scares you at first and then ultimately endears you. I's actually really nice and while it is very bitter on the finish, it still has very clean flavors on the palate and the bitterness doesn't linger too long. It also has a nice caramel malt character to stand up to the piney, resinous hops and bitterness. So it's actually fairly balanced for such an aggressively hopped beer. Quite impressive and enjoyable. 
 
Feel: It has a medium to medium plus mouthfeel with a bit of chewiness. Very clean. 
 
Overall: It's really good. I kind of liken this beer to a stronger version of Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale. For such a bitter and resinous beer, it's actually quite drinkable and refreshing! This is just my second Fat Head's Brewery & Saloon beer. Good stuff.

S - Big hops aromas of grapefruit and mandarin orange, but with another earthy note, similar to pineapple. There is a bit of bready malt in the finish, very restrained, like a saltine cracker. 
 
T - Strong, citrusy hops hit the mouth immediately, with navel orange, grapefruit and pine. The hop flavors are aggressive as hell and leave no room for malt to shine through. Exceptionally clean fermentation, with no yeast fruitiness noted. 
 
F - Medium body with a bit of mouth-coating effect, yet somehow the finish feels dry. Moderate to high carbonation gives a fizzy impression on the tongue. Hops bitterness strong enough to peel paint. Alcohol presence fairly high, which matches the listed ABV, but the strength seems appropriate with all the other heightened sensory inputs.

Duet,"This episode involved emptying two twelve ounce cans into a clear glass liter mug. The pours produced an overabundance of white foam on the top of a bright and light amber liquid. This one is about as translucent as any beer with a reasonable color can get. The aroma is mostly of hops, resinous and piney in character. It's not particularly rich. There's much less hop bite to taste than expected. What is there mixes poorly with whatever starch combination was used. There's an unpleasant, almost soapiness to taste until the finish. At least then, the Simcoe hops kick in and provide some clean and dry bitterness. All that foam and no glass lacing bears witness that this is short on body for an alleged IPA. On a positive note, the 7% ABV is nicely delivered. That should complete the compliments.",3.71

Taste: Kicks of with a lean, light biscuit-innards maltiness, with things going pretty dry and pretty bitter quickly.

I'm really glad I bought a four pack!",4.53
Imperial Biscotti Break,"In this rendition, it's a pint can emptied into a clear Imperial pint glass. The entire contents fit almost perfectly, as there's no extraordinary foam, just a modest and enduring dark biege head. The color of the liquid is the standard black coffee brown, no more, no less. Although the aroma is less than pungent, there is some roasted barley to be had, but the almond and vanilla additions just don't impress the nose. But, what a wonderful drink! There's the sweet malt of a great stout upfront, delivered within an incredibly rich body. Now the nuances: There's coffee, but it's not overly bitter, nor the dominating taste it can be, even in good coffee stouts. The vanilla only slightly sweetens the brew, but contributes as an extra layer, not a major taste emphasis. Almond inclusion adds body and another taste layer, without changing the overall and likely adds even more body to a brew certainly not lacking thereof. It's hard pressed to find a richer bodied stout than this one. Maybe there's not great glass lacing, but other than that, this is one of the best 10+% ABV brews out there. The alcohol is warming for sure, but not harsh and barely noticeable to taste. This is a great member of its style.",4.43
Imperial Biscotti Break,"L: Poured from a pint can into a sniffer - inky jet black pour with a huge head risen. About 3 fingers length to be exact. 
S: Getting predominant aromas for vanilla, along side with molasses, slight roasty coffee, chocolate and malt aromas. Not getting much of the almond in this. 
T: Getting a complexed mix of vanilla, chocolate, roasty coffee. You can taste the biscuit more so near the after taste of it all. Getting some after tastes of velvet as well. Almost similar to a chili brewed stout after taste to this. 
F: Heavy bodied, alcohol hides very well. Sipper but easy to sip. The taste is so smooth and tasty, it reminds me of a stout I had that had chili peppers brewed into it.

Medium body, pretty close to a cup of cappuccino actually. Overall, for the price this is pretty darned good. Not my favorite, but price wise you could consume this more regularly so, a winner.",3.84

Duet,"Golden orange with chill haze and a one finger white head. Nose is orange, tangerine, and some sugar. Taste follows the nose with a nice bite of grapefruit, orange, and tangerine pith and flesh followed by a short hint of pale malt. Body is light to medium with similar carbonation. Ends with a bitter citrus nuttiness. Overall not a bright as I thought it would be but solid characteristics. Maybe an older can? Cans says best by 12/22/22 and I’m opening it 9/2/22. Not sure how old it is?",4.03
Duet,"A well balanced citrusy IPA with a mixture of Pine and cedar notes. Displays a lighter orange color with nice head and nice citrus aromas. From the first sip you can taste the citrus, which was soon followed by the pine. This beer paired well on a warm day and was easily followed by a second. Exactly what I remembered from a west coast IPA.",4.59

Duet,,4.21
Duet,"Really solid beer. I had this one a few years back - it seems a bit different from what I remember or just what I expected in a West Coast IPA, but really a great beer. I have rounded my 'overall' up since my lower scores are probably more of a personal preference vs. a fault with the beer. I downgraded in the look and feel dept - looking ('hazy') and feeling ('juicy') like a NEIPA is not a positive for me. I was hoping for a crisper feel and clearer look. Nonetheless, I loved the foamy pour, the piney smell, and a real nice level of maltiness that tames the hoppy-ness. There's no doubt I would have this again.",4.14
Duet,,4.36
Duet,"Old school West Coast IPA. Piney and bitter with some citrus elements, backed up by a silky, full mouthfeel. Pours a bright coppery orange with a thin, persistent head. It's possibly being overrated here due to the pleasure of drinking an actual West Coast IPA and the sentimentality of a beer style that first introduced me to craft beer (and which I forced down in horror at the hoppy bitterness of it all!). 
 
Cheers",4.38
Duet,Very piney full ipa. Stronger flavor than most. Too much of a piney after taste for my liking. 1 is enough. All around the taste is good strong but the aftertaste is what lessens the score for me. I am a bigger fan of the Nelson and og lemon haze styles.,3.7
Hazelnut Brown Nectar,Pouring this is a must. Don't just drink out of a can or bottle. Beautiful color and excellent head retention make this a beauty on your table or desk or wherever you're enjoying it. The smell of hazelnut and chocolate hit you every sip. The taste is so rich but not overpowering. Great taste of the malt and hops mix perfectly. A weird side note: This beer is still damn good even if your glass gets a little warm.,4.87

Hazelnut Brown Nectar,Pours dark brown with caramel foam. No obvious scent. Tastes of nuts and brown sugar with quick finish. Average beer at best.,2.8
Hazelnut Brown Nectar,"12 oz. can, canned 03/08/22. 
 
Poured to a Duvel snifter. 
Pours a dark ruby body, some bubbles show when held to the light. Thick finger of frothy khaki-tan head that leaves good spotty lacing. 
Aroma is pleasantly toasty & nutty. Definitely invokes an authentic sense of earth / nuts / peanut / hazelnut. Slightly minerally / metallic. 
Flavor profile has some muddled notes to it: earthy, herbal, bitter, with notes of dark fruits (cherries, figs, dates). Almost retains a tart cherry juice sort of quality, not sure if this is due to the age of the beer or what. Hazelnut is not exactly the main player here, if you ask me. Does retain some earthy nuttiness (peanut, hazelnut), but tastes more earthy & herbal & hoppy than anything else. Not as roasty as expected. 
Feel is smooth, crisp, fairly easy-drinking. Carbonation is good. 
 
Overall, a middle of the road offering from Rogue, in my opinion. Surprised to see that this beer has such high ratings here on the site.

Smell - Fairly weak. Initial note is just metallic, but some toasted grains poke through after a bit. No real vanilla or anything though. 
 
Taste - Vanilla and milk chocolate. Doesn't even register as a beer really, more of some kind of dessert drink. It's not obnoxious or in-your-face though, it's got a bit of class and sophistication. 
 
Feel - A bit too thin-bodied for how I typically enjoy my dark beers. Could do with a bit more sparkle and pep as well.

Pours a deep inky brown with a one finger sandy head - settles into about a 1/2 finger ultra tightly bubbled ring and a loose cap. 4 
 
At fridge-ish temp I get some chocolate and associated sweetness and some malty body. though I do get that rich black licorice taking a whiff off the bottle. Coffee roast aromas begin to rise as it warms up. 4 
 
Roasted coffee, dull but spicy hop presence and a hint of that black licorice offer a nice and pleasing if not unexpected flavor. 3.75 
 
Light prickling carbo, but otherwise a lighter body for a stout with nice lingering aftertaste and smooth finish. 3.75

Kalamazoo Stout,"Somehow, Kalamazoo Stout is not among the 15 I've had previously from Bell's. I've always like Bell's and probably have not written a micro-review since the announced purchase by Kirin interests a year ago. I suppose I was waiting for something to happen; but the purchase seems not to have changed Bell's. And this is a very good thing because Bell's epitomized how crafters centered in and served their communities. It actually seems to provide purpose to growth over time. Bells did and as it grew it took on new responsibilities, most recently sustainability and DEI. I hope that continues and it is why I still give Bell's very good Overall Hugs. 
 
As for Kalamazoo... This follows the principle that if you don't try to do too much at first, it improves your chances of eventually becoming a classic. Many American stouts fell off the extreme edge, but Kalamazoo continues. And transcending the its strong licorice, my taste memory said: ""I've had this stout before, haven't I?"" I suppose I have; but it was not brewed by Bell's. It was brewed by a micro imitating and inspired by Kalamazoo. And that is what makes Kalamazoo a classic. Cheers !",3.98

IBU: 65 
Creamy, light tan head. Very dark chestnut, that appears almost on the border of black, for the appearance. Co-mingling of pine, grapefruit peel, with the lightest touch of medium dark roasted malt, rounding out the aroma. A touch sweet, mild grapefruit peel, pine and ample malt, for the taste.",4.25
Wookey Jack,"12oz can, about 3 months old 
 
Pours over two fingers of fluffy brown head into my snifter. Retention is amazing, after a solid few minutes there is still a sturdy finger of head. Lacing is perfect. Body is pitch black, even when held to the light. Looks magnificent. 
 
Nose is very spicey, paired with a full dose of fresh baked bread. Almost a candy sweetness, but it doesn’t come across gross at all. Smells fantastic. 
 
You get that rye in full force on the flavor, they really didn’t hold back here and I love it - rye is often hard for me to pick up. You also get some of that breadiness, the roast doesn’t come out until it gets a good while to warm. The black characteristics aren’t huge, but there is a deep maltiness that borders on molasses - it’s not gross or out of place at all. This might be a touch old, maybe that’s why some sweetness is coming out, but it’s aged quite well and has a nice smoothness once the eccentric spice passes - both being welcome. 
 
Carbonation is medium-low. Has a somewhat heavy body that is just the slightest bit cloying - some sugars are present, but mostly subdued by the substantial spice and moderate bitterness. A lovely mouthfeel. 
 
The drinkability is phenomenal, especially for a beer at this ABV, with this much going on. Neither the sugar, nor the spice slow me down one bit. 
 
A lovely little beer that starts with a hoppy rye kick, and transitions to a smoother darker offering.",4.38
Wookey Jack,"L - Deep black with some mahogany highlights with a light tan head that leaves behind a solid amount of lacing  
S - fresh bitter, piney hops, roasted dark malt, rye, slight hints of chocolate, floral notes and earth

F - Medium leaning towards full bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth and creamy  
O - A truly great black IPA",4.4

T: Roasted toasted chocolate malts, malted milk ball candy, an earthy hop bit combined with bitter & dense rye grains, unsweetened bakers dark chocolate, a hint of citrus zest, pine resin, plum, berries, dark fruit, gently woody. Finish is robust bitter. 
F: Firm, brisk, well carb'd then curves to a lightly churned, whipped, fluffy & plush, gently wet medium bodied mouthfeel w a med-length finish robust finish.

Wookey resembles an imperial stout; no highlights and a magnificent cappuccino head.  
 
Christmas tree, peppermint patty, lavender. There are layers of chocolate behind all the pine and herbal hops.  
 
Malted milk balls and almost a milk stout richness, though much more bitter and hopped than you’d find with that style. The pine returns in the backend, accompanied by more floral flavors like lavender and lilac, and earthy rye.  
 
Creamy medium body, medium carbonation. It’s silky but balanced.  
 
Definitely a good Black IPA with strong and interesting hopping.",4.25
Wookey Jack,"About pitch black with a robust sticky deep tan head.  
Nose is a pleasant blend of hood and malt/ caramel.  
Taste is like a toasted, charry beer that happens to have hops in there, like a dark pine forest. It all works, somehow. I never seek dark IPAs but made an exception when I saw this and having heard of how good it is. Toasted rye and tingly hops, slight hints of sweetness, maybe some coffee, but this is mostly an earthy beer.  
Feels medium- full and silky smooth yet with good carbonation.  
This surprised me a bit. Not my style, but this is just a very well-made beer. Don’t expect complexity or many different discernible flavors. This is mostly about crafting balance to a simple yet flavorful conclusion. Going forward if I ever try another “black IPA”, WJ is the beer to which it’ll be measured.",4.22

Duchesse De Bourgogne,"The brew is solid dark brown, more dull than shiny and opaque. A good deal of light is required to catch a reddish tint. This serving was drawn from a tap and presented in a clear pint glass. On top lays the most marginal of heads that's sort of biege. It brings those Belgian smells of yeast, malt, alcohol and some hops. The initial taste is a sweet and sour blast, more sweet until, as it finishes, a vinegar-like presence is detected. It's an enjoyable transition. Overall, this is malty big, with not much bite from the hops. That makes the sourness even more appreciated. There's much less alcohol to taste as there was in the aroma. Thankfully, the oak tannins don't turn this into something that tastes like a boilermaker. Even without a head, nor glass lacing, this looks good, especially since it went down so rich and smoothly. Perhaps it will take having a sweet tooth to love this one.",4.6
Duchesse De Bourgogne,,3.25
Duchesse De Bourgogne,"Rather sour, pleasantly so, with a lemony -lactate flavor.",3.84
Duchesse De Bourgogne,Nice palette cleanser to start off with. Good balance of cherry tartness and sweetness. The last batch I had in draft was noticeably sweeter than previous versions. I taste tested against the bottle and it was obvious. I hope it was merely an issue with that barrel and not a change in the recipe. Otherwise a great beer.,4
Duchesse De Bourgogne,,4.08
Duchesse De Bourgogne,"L - Brown with bright red hues and highlight with a tan head that dissipates somewhat slowly leaving behind a thin cal  
S - tons of Brett funk, bready yeast, sweet malts and fruit esters - red berries  
T - complex. Brett funk and bright cherry up front and throughout intermixed with notes of caramel, bready yeast, balsamic vinegar, figs and dates, maybe even some chocolate 
F - light bodied with high carbonation 
O - a truly unique and fantastic Belgian ale",4.51
Duchesse De Bourgogne,"This tastes like balsamic vinegar, with sweet fruity notes, woody notes, and cheesy notes, just like balsamic. I love balsamic. If you hate balsamic vinegar, this is not the beer for you. The beer does not feel thick like vinegar - it has a nice, drinkable mouthfeel. The beer does not look like vinegar - it has a lovely rich dark brown color. Although it does not look or feel like balsamic, it tastes like it. (A birthday gift from Carrie and Erik.)",3.64
Duchesse De Bourgogne,"Dark ruby red on the eyes and red wine vinegar on the nose. Full of fruit flavor dominated by cherry. It is both funky/sour and sweet with neither overpowering the other. Medium carbonation and feels like a wine, although maybe my mouth is influenced by my eyes. Very good, I would have one again.",4.33
Duchesse De Bourgogne,"Look: deep reddish brown with a beautifully thick, cream-colored head.  
 
Smell: I’m immediately reminded of red wine vinegar, but not in a bad way. Oak and some sort of red berry, with a distinct musty funk (again, not in a bad way).  
 
Taste: an elegant mix of sweet and sour, but not overall as complex as the nose. No real fruit in the taste, and not much funk beyond the general sour nature of the style.  
 
Feel: more carbonated than expected. Thin but not watery.  
 
Overall: one of the most wine-like beers I’ve ever tried. I come to this after already trying the sour cherry variant, and while I miss the cherries in this version it’s still an excellent beer and one of the defining examples of its style.",4.03

1+ finger beige sand colored head on a dark brown and opaque body. Good retention and early lacing. Big nose of leafy and earthy hops (I'd never place Citra and Amarillo) backed up solidly by roasty, and also earthy malts. Hint of menthol and coffee in a complex swirl of aromas. Flavors of mild citrus, lemon, and bitter/spicy malt. Medium (bright) body and carbonation, substantial bitter punch and a long, roasty and hoppy finish. Outstanding.",4.49

Wookey Jack,"Dark as a stout with a large tan head and very good lacing. Complex aroma. Not just the smokey, roasted malts but also licorice, dried fruit, pine and herbal hops. Taste keeps pushing the envelope as well. The resinous base pairs with the solid array of malts, especially the rye. The focus shifts with each sip and cannot be easily pigeonholed. Full bodied but not heavy. Bitter but not palate numbing. A good alcohol bite but not head spinning. Overall, it's not just about balance but how everything comes together",4.49

Wookey Jack,"Got a few cans sent to me by @JonPhisher, beer nerd extraordinaire. 
Poured very dark brown (black with dark brown edges) and had a *very* ambitious beige head which left sheets of lacing. 
The aroma, to my damaged nose, was coffeeish with a vegetable/plant like accent. Wet hay maybe? I figured I was smelling it wrong as I generally don't smell much at all. 
The taste was at first brash and harsh; all the bite of the roasted rye and copious hops were dominant. As it warmed the malts came out to play with rye bread and roasted grains, with almost a sweetness at times. The coffee and hops definitely shine the brightest, but are well supported by the other ingredients. 
The feel was lively due to the carbonation, added to the bite I enjoy so much in rye beers especially, didn't distract from the sweeter aspects though. Well done. 
OA, Very glad to have been able to try this, outstanding beer.",4.29
Wookey Jack,"Was so happy to hear that this beer was available again. Found that the Thistle Draftshop had it on draft and the family went with me on MLK day!

Crème Brûlée,"Poured into a chalice: color is black, head is light tan and presents with the nitro super fine bubbles on that initial pour.  
 
Smell is lightly boozy upfront, quickly overtaken by the creaminess - big lactose, really has that creamy aroma, some backing chocolate and roast.  
 
Taste is similar but the booziness is a backing flavor: big cream, lactose, lighter chocolate, some roast, booze. Flavor really emanates a thick cocktail like flavor.  
 
Mouthfeel is low nitro effervescence, strong/thick creamy sweetness, limited bitterness and even limited drying from the strength.  
 
Overall a big, creamy sweet brew that gives off a creamy cocktail vibe (white russian-esque).",4
Crème Brûlée,"This is just sweeter than the hot cocoa one but that's really about the whole super prevalent difference. I feel like trying this one made me like them both a little less. Sweet, boozy, run of the mill. Southern Tier is super overrated as a whole to me. There's great desert beers and pastry stouts everywhere. Try something new. I will say this shits on their ipas in the since these are better at being stouts than the ipas are at being ipas. At least this is supposed to be sweet.",3.84
Crème Brûlée,"Experience says that this is among the best of the desert beers. Now it's time for a critical review. Two twelve ounce cans are opened and all of the contents of one and most of the contents of the second can are fitted instead a clear glass Imperial pint mug. There's an amazing vanilla smell in the air and the beige head, preventing the entire drainage of the second can, is one of the tightest and enduring in the beer world. It adorns a beautiful black coffee colored liquid that's opaque, but reasonably bright. Behind the sharp vanilla nose hit, found is creamy sweetness, kind of like the smell gotten from an aerosol whipped cream. For its color, there's very little reference to roasted malt. There is some roasted malt bitterness in the taste. So much so that it detracts from the intended target. But, it's a mild infraction, as there's enough smooth and creamy character to carry most of the taste. Actually the stout bitterness doesn't really kick until the finish. Until then, this is an amazing liquid reminder of a pleasantly sweet desert, without the crusty covering. There's great glass lacing and a well disguised 10% ABV. Maybe not perfect, but this is one great desert beer.",4.62

Crème Brûlée,"650 ml bottle, as Southern Tier Imperial Crème Brûlée Stout, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 10.0%. Pitch black colour, big tan head. Intense aroma of crème brûlée and vanilla from the moment you open the bottle, amazing! The smell includes caramel, of course - but also chocolate and mild coffee. The sweet flavour is first and foremost crème brûlée again, but also roasty notes of strong coffee, dark bitter chocolate and liquorice. Also some hoppy bitterness in the finish. Warming mouthfeel. An incredible dessert beer!",4.05
Crème Brûlée,"Looks: At 9.6 ozs. should have poured it into a smaller glass. LOL. Nice thick creamy head about 1/2 inch tall. Great lacing on the glass. Smooth tan on top and strong black coffee color on the bottom. 
Smell and Taste: This beer really does resemble Creme Brûlée. Vanilla, and burnt sugar on cream. Great combination.  
Feel: Nitro makes it smooth and soft. 
Overall: This its one of the easiest beers I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. Bumped the OA score down some because of the short pour. Should have ben packaged in a can the size of a pint. At least it would have come closer to filling my glass. I would definitely drink this one again but as an after dinner drink, like desert.",4.45

Crème Brûlée,,4.35
Crème Brûlée,"Pours a cola brown color with a very creamy beige head, 1/4” cap was present for the duration. 
 
Nose is seriously sweet with caramel, brown sugar, sweet cream and vanilla bean. 
 
Flavor begins with caramel and vanilla, roasted coffee flavor comes on to offer some balance. Boozy alcohol warmth plays in the background the whole time. 
 
Finish leans toward the bitter from the coffee, the sweetness and alcohol warmth are still there though. 
 
Viscous body and subtle carbonation let this one hang on the palate a little, but it’s a desert beer in every way, so this wasn’t surprising. 
 
Not a daily drinker, good to keep a few on hand for the colder months though.",3.83

Looks great, yellow, slight haze. Smells like a Belgian but with a fruity edge. Tastes much better when poured out.

Next stop, Goose Island. Continuing on with my Chicago beer escapade, I just had to stop at this legendary brewery for some good beers here and to go. Let’s see what their classic Saision is all about 
 
Pours a cloudy yellow gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing 
 
There’s not much funk or tartness to the nose as I tend to prefer in the style, but the earthy vibe is still quite nice. I’m picking up on aromas of white pepper, lemon zest, white tea, crackery malt, tannic white wine, wildflower honey, pear skin, and earthy wheat 
 
Likewise in taste it is more just straight earth than funk, and again still good. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting lemon zest, crackery malt, wildflower honey, white tea, peppery hops, apple skin, and light toast. The swallow brings notes of clove, bready malt, white grape, honey, peppery hops, pear skin, and a touch of vanilla 
 
A light medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a crisp and sharp beer. Finishes mostly dry and refreshing 
 
This is a nice, well rounded Saison. Nothing to seek out but good nonetheless",4.07

There is an abundant amount of carbonation to watch parade to the top. The half inch of fluffy white head did recede to a thin cap after several minutes. 
The aroma is quite noticeable from a distance. For starters there is a sweet fruity citrus, I am leaning toward notes of orange. There is a pleasant yeast and wheat mixture happening also. 
The wheat is the first thing I am picking up, a little yeast, then the orange peel. The finish is slightly bitter, a tad dry, with a bump of pepper spice. 
This is an easy drinker, not heavy, a medium smooth feel.",4.02

Sofie,"A Saison found the day after Saison Day. Better late, but unfortunately, this was the only one available. Two brown twelve ounce bottles have been emptied into a clear glass liter mug. It's a light amber liquid, really not much different in color than most lagers. There is a bit more opaqueness than lagers generally have. A nice modest and enduring white head is included. The glass lacing is even less. The smell is vaguely yeasty and perhaps a little perfume-llke. The taste is yeasty and perfume-llke, but mildly refreshing. It certainly is much lighter in feeling and taste than an IPA. Not everyone will appreciate that as a good thing. Orange peel is included in the mix. It's there, but not a heavy influence on the taste. Probably it adds to a dry bitterness that shows at the finish. That part is well done, for without it, this could be a yeasty mess. There's no evidence this has an ABV above five percent other than to read it on the label. Probably average for the style, this isn't going to convert a hop loving DIPA devotee. Yet, for a once a year change, it wasn't such a terrible thing.",3.12

Hop Rod Rye,"16oz can poured into a New Belgium globe. 
 
A: Dark ruby red color with lighter orange hues. Super healthy head formation and retention. A solid two and a half fingers of cream-coloered head stick around for the duration and leave behind gobs of chunky lacing in a loose ring formation. 
 
S: Juiced ruby red grapefruit, pine and resin, green and spicy hop oils. Underlying malt toastiness, sharper earthy rye spice, and a distinct crystal malt sweetness that brings a touch or berry/candy shell. Clean fermentation profile, probably chico yeast.  
 
T: Opens with a fat crystal malt sweetness. Caramel, toffee, and candy shell. This very quickly gives way to a drying blanket of toastiness, flashes of burnt crust, and a lot of spicy rye. Hop profile hits hard and fast with a lot of vibrant and bitter ruby red grapefruit juice. Butter line and resin too, along with an oily and green spiciness. Bitterness is quite firm. The finish dries quite a bit with long lingering rye spice, oily hop bitterness, and traces of soot.  
 
M: Full bodied with some chewiness and a very round and creamy malt texture. Plenty of raking hop astringency too. Ample carbonation scrubs firmly. 
 
O: What a throwback. I do think this is the first rye IPA I ever had, circa 2008, but I can't remember ever revisiting it before today. I do miss rye beer in general, and feel like it got unfairly buried under the sea of west coast and hazy IPAs. This particular beer is considered a venerable classic within the rye sub-styles, and deservedly so. I love what they've done with the hop profile: the rye is unabashedly bold, and there's some interesting specialty malt character to round things out and create just enough balance to ground the bitterness and spiciness. Drinking it bakes me feel like I pulled something special out of the beer archives, but in this case I didn't have to blow any dust off of it because it was nice and fresh at my local packie.",4.11

The look: Onyx.  
 
The Smell: At times the scent of dark malted barley (literally) and coco nibs.  
 
Taste: When traveling the exhausting terrain of Tralfamadore, my senses were heightened. Ever since then every beer tastes precisely the same, except a traditional stout. A lovely biscuit, dark chocolate, and roasty veggies would pair well. The brew itself, roasty and slightly bitter (not the style). 
 
Feel: Completely devoid of human interaction I found the comfort in the only beverage available to humans. A ""Toutshsawgoh"". The first sip of this threw me into a stupor. My mouth felt a cozy, forthy, and welcoming presence to these parched lips. 
 
Overall: For every action, there must always be an equal and opposite reaction... so said the doctor. Gallifrey mustn't have any porters or stouts, since this brew allows bipedal individuals to time travel just to taste it.

Guinness Extra Stout (Original),"Have had before but first time reviewing 
 
Allowed to acclimate to room temperature for 15 minutes and poured into a tulip pint glass (not a tulip glass). 
 
Pours black (I've read Guinness is actually very dark red) with beautiful dark amber mixing with red hints around the edges, with a 3 finger khaki head with foam that remains like seafoam when the head dissipates. 
 
Initial aroma is slightly metallic, followed by light olive green hoppy and dark tan bitter smells. Smells almost as if it doesn't have much body. 
 
Initial taste is bitter and a little sour, followed by malty, as well as slightly reminiscent of purple grape soda, when this mixes with the bitterness it's a little like grape medicine, but not unpleasant at all. More bitter in the aftertaste mixing with cocoa that lingers on the back of the tongue and the back of the roof of the mouth. It's dry throughout the entire tasting process, as you would expect an Irish dry stout to be. As I get more than halfway through I notice a note of molasses, as well as a general sweetness throughout in addition to the bitterness. 
 
Mouthfeel is richer than average, overall smooth, it goes down very easily and I have zero complaints about it, but unfortunately I struggle to find any ways to describe what the carbonation does in the mouth or how it sits on the tongue. 
 
Will buy again at some point, but were it not attached to the Guinness name I don't know if I would and I find myself leaning towards not. Overall a solid beer.",3.67

The pour produces a heavy finger of frothy, variously bubbled, somewhat lasting, light tan head that leaves a thin pasty wash of lace. Aroma is hop forward earthy, floral, grapefruit, pine with a fruity hint, rye bread and rye spice. Taste is nicely balanced: earthy, grapefruit, orange zest, pine: caramel malt heavy, rye spice and a hint of chocolate. Sweet, lightly bitter finish with a caramel bitter aftertaste. The 8% ABV is well hidden with pleasant warming appearances in the finish and aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy with moderate carbonation, very smooth, creamy and rich. Very, very nice.",4.4

Cloudy, pale gold colored body. Two fingers of white head retreat to make a cap and ring. Leaves behind scattered strings of lacing. 
Aroma of wheat and floral/citrus hops.

312 Urban Wheat,"I personally like the redesign, hardly the reason I tried these tho, had first time at a Cubs game in the club, tried something new… 
Nbsoc; 
A new generation ‘Miller or Meister Brau,’ when purchased fresh this actually is a great American beer. Aroma and flavor provide some Cascade hop resin and Millennium bittering add a lot of character to this very drinkable beer! A lot of people hunt for ‘dry hopped orange juice’ beer, I personally prefer a hoppy lemon grass flavor, and that comes nicely with this beer. Head starts as a great blossom, good for this style, dissipates sort of fast but does not effect the whole experience, if anything drinking it with head into drinking it with no head is part of what adds a hazy character and some dynamic interest to the glass when drinking a deceivingly simple beer. Minimal malt presence and small noble hop spices draw this style back to a more traditional result, as well as some actually quality feeling wheat, a lot of elements add to the presence and quality of this beer.  
 
Definitely will drink again, and would recommend for summer gatherings, personal recommendation to anyone just trying to have a good beer without a lot of thought and at a great price point! Tell ‘em Colossal Cascade hops sent ya! Hahahahaa",3.8

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 
500mL bottle (code10.207 2 / 0393 2823) poured into a weizen glass. Pours a beautiful hazy copper-brown color with a ridiculous off-white head and cascading carbonation. Head condenses to a thick rocky pillow of foam that recedes slowly. Big pockets of air develop within the massive head around the sides of the glass; frothy lacing forms in its wake. There's a bright amber glow where the light reflects up from the bottom of the glass, then the beer gets darker as you reach the top. Just a gorgeous beer to behold. 
 
Aroma is overripe bananas, sweet malt, clove and other spices. Nice fruity, floral aroma with a hint of yeast. 
 
Taste is a mouthful of spotty brown bananas, sweet bready malt, raisins, yeast, and spice. This is the definition of mellow. Nice clean mouthfeel that leaves a pleasant sweet aftertaste. The high ABV is hidden extremely well.

Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,"500mL bottle with the new nonsense date code. 
 
On the pour 2 fingers of off white to tan head that became rocky and a bit foamy over a few minutes, until finally settling at a decent tan cap. Body is a dark amber to copper, with a bit of haze, but light still comes through. 
 
Aroma carries sweet fig and toffee/caramel, but there is a slight savory oxidation thing going on. Alcohol isnoticeable, but not boozy. 
 
Taste follows the sweet malty notes, but loses the off notes. I'm going to blame the aroma on bottle age, which for now is unfortunately uncontrollable. Traditional banana hefeweizen flavor comes through with a sweet caramelized flavor coming from the malts. Honestly very easy to drink and comes off as a Dunkelweizen to my untrained American palate. Still there is some light figgy fruit going on but this is mostly a very enjoyable dark, strong, traditional tasting hefeweizen. Nice balancing hop bitterness, but no hop aromas. 
 
 
Feel is smooth and easy drinking. This beer hides its ABV well once it's on your palate. Slight astringency, but this isn't a dry beer. At the same time this beer doesn't come off as huge and thick. The astringency balances the malt well leading to the easy drinking feel of this. Medium long finish, but it's subtle. Soft subtle, but present, carbonation. 
 
Overall there are flaws, but this is one of my favorite general doppelbock style beers I've ever had, although, it is the only weizen-doppelbock I've tried. Nice traditional hefeweizen flavor merged with delicious caramel sweet malts, as well as a nice balancing bitterness. Smells a bit funny when it gets old though.",4.14

Curmudgeon,"A 2016 version, poured out of a 32oz crowler that I picked up @ SLL in Sept. 21. I’ve always enjoyed this beer fresh and cold, but leaving this beer out and sipping my way through it was great for exposing the beer’s full spectrum of aromas and flavors. This is one of the most inviting beers, if based on looks alone - a beautifully clear deep amber body is capped with a dense light tan head that clings to the glass as it slowly recedes. Note that the last of the crowler poured a bit murkier and more caramel colored than amber. The aromas are initially dominated by a mix of over ripe orchard fruits and darker, sweet, dried fruits on a raisin toast-like malt base. There is a hint of vanilla and a good dose of other oak-barrel, bourbon-like alcohol flavors to stiffly balance this beers rich base. As it warms, there’s nutty/hazelnut, caramel and toffee notes that come forward in the taste. If there’s a moment where the hops shine, it’s mid-finish where they come across as mildly herbal and lightly spicy. Medium to full-bodied with just enough carbonation and abv to keep the beer from coming across as too heavy. I haven’t had many old ales as of late, and the [English] one’s I remember were quite different. Overall, for someone who really likes big, complex, aged ales - this beer is a standout.",4.12

Curmudgeon,"355 ml bottle, from Voldby Købmandsgaard. ABV is 9.8%. 50 IBU. Cloudy brown colour, low beige head of poor retention. Sweetish malty aroma, notes of caramel and oak, hints of dark dried fruits and alcohol. Not as sweet flavour as I feared, malty and oaky, caramel and dried figs, well balanced with the hops, a nice bitterness in the finish and aftertaste. Would buy again.",3.83
Curmudgeon,"Just about as beautiful a brew can be. A request for a pint came from a tap, in a clear glass vessel. The color is a dark copper, bright, yet not translucent. The head is just barely biege, enduring and contributes to some wonderful glass lacing. The aroma is malty, almost stout-like malty. This is also good inside the mouth. It's rich, sweet, smooth and malty. But that's not all. Molasses and hops bring an earthiness that, without being bitter, enhance what would make a good ale, like a Wee Heavy Scottish Ale. The almost 10% ABV is unnoticed. That it's on the heavy side is a good thing, for any lighter, it would go down too quickly for the overall welfare of its consumer. Overall, complexly excellent.",4.5

La Fosse,"Taking inspiration from famous Brussel's apricot sour ale, Side Project is brewing more like pros when brewing and aging their own unique spin on the fruited gueuze style. 
 
La Fosse brings a golden tinge to an otherwise bubbly champagne pour. But the beer strikes the nose with force as the overwhelming sour scent tightens the jaws and wets the whistle with fruit, funk and fauna. A scantly sweet introduction is of light wafer, sourdough and a brief hint of taffy. 
 
But anything seeming sweet is short and succinct on the middle palate. The session quickly favors the stone fruit with a light orange, mango and peach character. Shying away from fruit rollup, the beer quickly trends vinous and winey with sharp chardonnay, bubbly dryness and a piquant spice. Its bracing acidity washes any thirst from the palate as the late taste brings an earthen tone of balsa, burlap and extended wood-age white wine. 
 
Light, crisp and highly refreshing, the ale is a cleaner taste compared to more Brussels brewed versions, but this brighter, cleaner and fruitier version is just as good.",4.49

Excited to finally be trying the world renowed Trappist Tripel by Westmalle. Acquired at the local Binny's, I've had this sitting in the fridge for a couple of months.. 
 
Poured to Piraat stemware. 
A: Pours a nicely crisp golden body, deep in color, rich looking. Pillowy finger point five of creamy white frothy head. Good thick ribbons of lacing. Looks excellent for sure. 
S: Good creamy aroma. Notes of orchard fruits, apples, pears, leaves. 
T: Taste follows, lots of crisp orchard fruits, green apple, pear. Cidery, with a hot alcoholic bite at the end. 
F: Feel is a bit thick & heavy. Well-carbonated, but definitely a beer you will want to sip slowly. Alcohol content is hot & boozy, reminiscent of nail polish remover / booze fumes. 
Overall, it was fun to try, and I'm definitely interested in trying more authentic trappist made ales, but Tripels are typically not my thing to begin with. The quality of the ingredients shows, but the booziness killed it for me.

Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,"Poured into a chilled glass at about 38F. Pours a cloudy very light orange with an off-white head that sticks around for a while and leaves slight lacing. Smell is typical wheat and yeast, along with a slight musty bitterness that is actually quite pleasant. Taste is very nice with slight banana, wheat, vanilla and yeast. Very crisp and quite a dry finish. Carbonation is fairly high, which brings out the wheat character. Overall, great beer.

Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,"12oz bottle poured into a Teku glass. 
Look is a somewhat hazy golden yellow with two fingers of white head. The head has fairly good retention. 
Smell is a little below medium in strength. The smell of vanilla is slightly strongest and bfollowed by banana, clove, funk, yeast and a musty smell. It has somewhat of a banana bread smell. The balance in the smell is outstanding but the musty smell lowers it to very good. 
Taste is medium-low in strength. The taste follows the nose with the addition of a peppery taste. The flavor is very good. I'm very disappointed how light the flavor is. So, the light flavor makes it good at best. 
Feel is medium in thickness. There's barely any creaminess which is extremely unfortunate for this style. Carbonation is medium. It's somewhat dry. The lack of creaminess is unforgivable. 
Overall, this beer went down hill and then died with the feel. Hefeweizens are my favorite beer style. After this six-pack, I won't buy this beer again.",3.42

A&S: The beer's appearance is bright orange at first and moves to a muddy orange as the remaining beer and sediment are poured in. The head is fizzy and big, there is some lacing. The aroma is powerful! Chalky yeast, tart peaches, and apricots. 
 
T&M: The taste is acidic, fruity, tart, and lemony. Very clean. Cereal finish. Tartness is cleared out when the sediment is poured in and the funk comes through more than before. The high carbonation is champagne-like at first, then comes in a little more creamy later on.

Devil Dancer,"12oz bottle courtesy of Whyteboar. According to the stamp on the rear label, this was bottled on January 16, 2020. Perhaps not ideal for a normal IPA, but as the same rear label makes clear, this ain't no normal IPA, as it clocks in at a fierce 12% abv! 
 
Poured into a tulip-shaped hybrid glass (don't know what else to call it), this was a dark amber color, taking on a rubyish hue when held up to light. About an inch or so of beige colored foam was present as head, and left a decent amount of lace for such a strong beer. 
 
Nose was of herbal grassy hops, bready malts, plus a little bit of band aid type aroma. As it warms, it gets a bit boozy. 
 
More promising in the flavor department than in the nose. Grapefruity, piney, peppery and bready - this is a big beer that makes a big impact on the taste buds. Quite a bit of alcohol ""heat"" is present. Unsurprisingly, for a triple IPA from the midwest, there's a massive malt backbone, so for the hops to stand out as much as they do, there must have been an ungodly amount used. 
 
Medium to full body, with a coating, resiny, almost syrupy mouthfeel.  
 
This is a beast! I imagine this is a beer that is very expensive to make, and get why it's not widely distributed at this point. Enjoyed this in the middle of the afternoon on a day with no commitments outside the home, and that's probably for the best! Thank you for getting this to me, Craig! It's one I've long been wanting to try!",3.96

Maudite,"12oz bottle best by February 2nd 2026 
 
On the pour 3 fingers of fluffy off white head formed on top of a dark reddish brown, and hazy body. Over a couple minutes the head fades to a 0.5cm covering. Sporadic lacing forms. 
 
Aroma is a bit hollow on the first impression. There is a strange almost metallic or mineralic earthiness, before a sweet caramel malt comes though and some nice Belgian yeast spiciness. There is a bit of a funk. 
 
Flavor is very nice with a slight bitterness along with a bready pumpernickel maltiness. The spicy yeast comes in strong with cloves vanilla and cinnamon, not to mention the actual spices that were used during brewing. Then a nice fade into a mellow, sweet, and almost mulled malty finish that is slightly chocolate. The bitterness fades fast. 
 
The feel on this beer is full, but dry, and surprisingly drinkable for the abv. The 8% still makes itself known, but in a friendly relaxing way. Super smooth and cozy. It reminds me of the holidays. 
 
Overall this was a nice surprise. Easy drinking and mellow for this style of beer. Full flavor and cozy comforting maltiness, but no clear alcohol burn make this very nice as a beer after a long day at work.",3.99

Susan,"Golden amber with a modest and enduring off-white head, a full clear pint glass full just spilled out of a tap head. As with many hazies, this doesn't punch the nose, but it is pleasant. There's a pleasant starchy backing for resinous hops, which aren't at all that bitter to smell. There's a near perfect softness to the mouthfeel, just like a hazy styled AIPA should provide. Unlike too many others, it's neither too thin, nor too sticky. The same goes for the hopping. It, too, is close to perfect for the style. It's vaguely resinous, with a hint of a spice like lemongrass, coriander or pepper. With some nice glass lacing, this also looks close to perfect. Overall, this is one incredibly good beer. Outside of New England, this is a rare find. When it shows, beer geeks are on their phones to their buddies and it doesn't last long.",4.87

Alright, it’s time. The highest rated American IPA on BA!! I’ve been wanting to try this one for quite some time, and I’m thrilled to finally get the opportunity to. I’ve been seeing more Hill Farmstead beers near me as time goes on, and I’m excited by all of it. Let’s see if it can truly live up to the hype 
 
Pours a lightly cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves nice lacing 
 
The nose is somewhat delicate, for lack of a better word, but still shows an excellent balance of all of its elements that ends up turning out really nice. I'm picking up on aromas of orange zest, pine sap, bready malt, grassy hops, honey, pineapple juice, white pepper, grapefruit zest, and light orange marmalade 
 
In taste it falls a little bit flat of the complexity on display in the aroma, not exactly one-dimensional but more focused on bitterness. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting grapefruit zest, piney hops, bready malt, weed, white pepper, honey, light passionfruit, and pineapple. The swallow brings notes of crackery malt, white pepper, piney hops, fresh cut grass, honey, grapefruit zest, passionfruit, and light orange 
 
A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick and sharp beer. Finishes mostly dry with a firm bitterness 
 
While I think this is quite good, it's nothing mind blowing. There's better examples of the style out there, but I'd also like to try this fresher one day, as I've heard HF can be really particular about the best by dates on their IPAs",4.34

Brewers Notes: Collaboration with J. Wakefield Brewing 
 
We took our original J. Wakefield collaboration Affogato Imperial Stout and aged it in bourbon barrels for 6 months at our Hudson Road barrel house. Affogato Imperial Stout is inspired by a few of our brewers' favorite summertime pick-me-up (& cool-me-down) Barrington's affogato. 
 
Barrel Aged Affogato Imperial Stout is decadent, rich and full. Brewed with a blend of Barrington & Mostra beans, Affogato leads with aromas of vanilla, toasted marshmallows and subtle notes of bourbon. Barrel Aged Affogato has a full, satisfying body and an indulgent palate of vanilla cream, hot cocoa, rich brownie batter, with complimentary doses of smooth coffee and bourbon. 
 
MALT: American 2-Row Barley, Crystal 120, Flaked Oats, Black Malt, Chocolate Malt, Munich Malt, White Wheat Malt, Brown Sugar, Dark Candied Syrup, Lactose 
HOPS, ETC: Columbus, Barrington and Mostra Coffees, Madagascar Vanilla Beans

L: slightly-hazy medium amber-colored liquid; not a huge head on the pour, but it's tight with a frayed cotton contour... only holds a thin collar, thin misty cap; does leave a big band of lace oppo of sip spot 
 
S: very floral initial pop (rosewater), followed by some fleshy orange pulp, lemon/grapefruit zest, background hint of pine... a little honeyish malt wants to poke through... gummy orange slices... only a soft essence of alcohol... excellent overall intensity 
 
T: citrus kiss, but a rush of florality right behind it... the aftertaste is spicy, with a green bitterness that slowly swells... certainly a big malty base, with a muffin/cakey quality, but it's sodden with hop resins... vague dried pale-colored fruit (apricot, sultana) slowly creeps into the aftertaste, while the residual bitterness grows some peppery hair to it... the volume on the bitterness just keeps increasing, speakers cracking and shaking; hop artifacts emerge 
 
F: its bitter bite takes hold on the tongue, mildly intensified by the ethanol, which sets and singes (and yet cools?!) a touch near the back of the palate... its body and resins make for a silky lusciousness up front, giving way to a growing heat; soft carbonation 
 
O: why did this take so long to be released out east here(?), especially considering Furious had been here for years now; this was the first Surly beer I ever heard of c. 2011 (though Darkness and Bender weren't far behind)...

While the can is over a couple of months old, the ale still tasted very fresh. I rate it as having a NE flavor profile while having a west coast appearance. It is translucent and golden, but definitely not cloudy. The head was white and not too foamy. The aromas came in waves of sweet fruit. The flavor came in waves and it seemed each one was a different type of tropical fruit. What a fantastic drinking experience.

Appearance: Pours a slightly cloudy (80% clarity) medium orange color with a strong white head. SRM of 9. (4.00) 
 
Aroma: Strong aromas of rich grapefruit, tropical mango and melon. Resinous, earthy, and tropical. Some tropical peach evolves as it warms. (4.25)

Compared to Surly Axe Man 2/2023: Pours darker, hazier. Stronger aromas. More sweet and juicy tangerine and peach. Less dank berry and pine notes.

Abrasive Ale 
Surly Brewing 
Imperial IPA 
Date: 17 Dec 2021 
Another beer that I have wanted to be marked off my list. The beer is 46 degrees, and I used a tulip glass. A frothy and airy two-fingered bright white head was created. The slow dissipation left loads of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 6, deep golden yellow. Clarity is brilliant, with a few carbonation bubbles dancing within. The appearance of the beer is excellent.  
Ripe grapefruit and juicy melon are what I immediately pick up. Smelling beer again, I detect pine, bready, yeasty, honey-like sweetness, oranges, floral esters, and herbal.  
Interesting, I get pineapple, mango, grapefruit, floral, and herbal notes from the first sip. Taking another, I taste bread dough, oranges, pine, lightly toasted malts, pharmaceutical, and a touch of dank.  
The mouthfeel is sticky, sweet, and coating. The body is medium, the carbonation is low, and the finish lingers.  
This is not what I was expecting for this beer. The malts are heavy and drown out the hops. The hop profiles are unique in is own way. I was expecting something like a WCIPA and got a hybrid. I would not say this beer is abrasive. When I think of an abrasive beer, I think of Ruination, the first one, not this newer crap. The beer is okay; nothing special stands out as amazing.",4.11

A dense creamy head of 1 cm of tan foam rises up from the pour and quickly fades to a sturdy edge layer that sticks around throughout my sampling. There are also a few small islands spinning in the center of the glass. Also get some scattered lacing when I swirl the glass or take a sip. 
Aroma is malt forward with milk chocolate, vanilla, brown sugar and a good whiff of bourbon note. No warm or fusol alcohol more of the sweet side of bourbon. Also no hop presence here at all on the nose. 
First sip reveals a very smooth textured medium bodied beer with fine soft and gentle carbonation. The carb is very fine and gentle, which all makes for a velvety smooth physical experience. 
Flavor is what the nose advertises, with sweet chocolate, brown sugar and some vanilla, all giving way to bourbon notes and a little warming on the swallow. Bourbon flavor lingers and also coats my lips. I do get a little bit of a coffee note in the back of each swallow too. Again, no hops to be found. 
Quite a nice imperial milk stout, one that I would gladly drink again.",4.48

Poured into a snifter, this was an inky black, with no interest in becoming any lighter even when held up to light. Modest, half inch of khaki-mocha colored head. Sparse, spotty lacing. 
 
Bourbon up front in the nose, along with milk chocolate and coffee notes, pretty much in that order. 
 
More complex in the taste than in the nose. Still bourbon-y up front, and with a milk chocolatey sweetness, but there's also a bit of tobacco and dark fruit to the flavor. It all melds together very, very well.  
 
Body is a little bit lighter than I expected, but not to a deal-breaking extent. Mouth feel is fairly creamy. 
 
This is a very nice BBA stout, one that hit the spot after dinner tonight. Earlier this week I found out for certain that my Mom does not have stomach cancer, as was feared for a time. I decided to drink this beer today to celebrate that fact, and I don't think I mis-chose at all. I would happily drink this beer again as a dessert or nightcap. Thanks, Russ!",4.36
BDCS,"Opaque dark brown body; thick, creamy, light tan head. Milk chocolate and vanilla tones on the nose. Incredibly smooth and complex flavors; milk chocolate; very subtle sense of whiskey; vanilla; light cinnamon spiciness; light bitterness peeking below the overall sweetness. Heavy body; dense and silky on the palate; very muted boozy warmth. 
 
This is just an awesome barrel aged imperial stout - a double cream stout per the notes. The base beer really shines while the barrel aging amplifies but doesn't overpower the beer. Depth and complexity are rife with this beer. Very, very tasty.

O. M. G. 
 
The taste is as described on Ozark’s website - a bourbon soaked brownie, with the added caveat of dark cherry flavor that works spectacularly well with the fudge and bourbon barrel flavors. This is frighteningly easy to drink for a 10.2% ABV BA stout.  
 
The mouthfeel is rich, decadent, and creamy. Simply delightful. One thing to note - one of the cofounders worked for Goose Island, and brewed that brewery’s BCBS. 
 
He apparently learned a lot, because this beer takes the best of BCBS and cranks up the drinkability quotient. This is the best beer I’ve had in 2022, and may be a Top 10 overall beer for me.

BDCS,"Bringing a little heat to the party, Ozark Beer allows for an extended aged Imperial Stout to bring all the bourbony warmth that would ever want to be inside of a beer.  
 
Dark and tawny garnet brown, BDCS '22 hits the glass with an ominous looking pour with a dainty trickle of foam for decoration. As a bourbon laced scent of dark roast coffee, caramel, maple, chocolate and toasted nuttiness lays across the nose, the flavors open up with a sweet heat of coconut, chocolate, molasses, vanilla and caramel. 
 
As the sweetness is quickly chased away by the roast and booze, the flavors of espresso sets in with baker's chocolate, roasted walnut and campfire to follow. Interrupted by the barrel, the flavors soon dominate with the strong oaken, toasted wood, weathered barrel influence with savory heat and bitter spices to close. 
 
Full bodied, full flavored and laying on the tongue with a heated glaze, the stout finishes both hot and sweet with a linger of savory heat in a long lasting afterglow.",4.02

Impermanence has a creamy and silky mouthfeel that makes it a pleasure to drink. The texture is thick and smooth, coating the palate.

Pours a dark reddish-brown body, one finger white head, good retention, not much lacing or film. Smells of jammy raspberry and a touch of stonefruit, a bit of funk, a bit of dark fruit and a bit of oak. This is the stuff of dreams. Big fruit presence with a complex barrel presence- that's what an AWA is supposed to be, right? Flavour is very similar; tons of jammy raspberry. Some stone fruited plum. Bright vibrant fruit sweetness intermingles in with dark fruit and the parent spirits. A bit of warming heat on the end, not unlike whiskey served neat. Mild fruity funk, but overall the fruit is the star of the show. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, soft and perfectly carbonated, and you get very little hint of the 10% ABV aside from the warming feeling as it goes down. Superb, very complex. Overall, another wonderful, heavy fruit jammed acetic wild from two of the best brewers in the US doing this type of wild ale. It's quite balanced! Nowhere near as sour as everyone has made it out to be, even more fruit than expected, and that's saying a lot.",4.53

Orviamo,"750ml bottle, poured into a Side Project oversized wine glass. Generously shared by Erik, enjoyed on 1.16.16, reviewed from Tasting Journal. 
 
The beer pours a deep maroon color, hues of burgundy and crimson, hazy and cloudy with a bone colored head, about a finger high that has good retention and lace. The aroma is very intense and very complex, all of the barrels are immediately present. Very fruity, loads of raspberry, prunes and very cherry forward, strong port wine, tannic, acidic, vinous, very rich, very deep with soft oak, a bit of vinegar and some potent booze character. The flavors offer a bit more in terms of balance and lets each element breathe. Still, the various barrels are front and center, loads of port wine, vinous red wine and rich and oaky bourbon with a fantastic helping of raspberry and plum, more plum than the nose suggested, delicate and tart with some light vinegar and some warming alcohol. The mouthfeel is nice, coating, lively, almost juicy at times with a medium body and a crisp finish. 
 
Verdict: A very intense Wild Ale from Side Project and De Garde, perhaps too much at once. Rich, complex with great depth, but at times, the balance is lacking and the 10% ABV is very apparent.",4.07

For the second time in one Tree House run, we have yet another TH beer in the BA top 250! This one currently sits at #168, and #2 for Milk Stouts, just under their own Moment Of Clarity. Funnily enough, they are both Milk Stouts aduncted with coffee, chocolate, and maple syrup. Let’s crack it open and see how they differ 
 
Pours completely pitch black with 3 fingers of creamy dark tan head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves decent lacing 
 
The nose is very sweet and maple-forward, but there’s a delicate balance from the roast. I’m picking up on aromas of sweet maple syrup, vanilla, milk chocolate truffle, caramel, brown sugar, medium roast coffee, and light nougat 
 
Once again in taste, there’s a lot of maple, but the balance is even more amazing here. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting sweet maple, toasted oak, dark chocolate, medium roast coffee, brown sugar, light coconut, and dark caramel. The swallow brings notes of sweet maple, chocolate fudge, dark caramel, toasted oak, brown sugar, medium roast coffee, and light molasses 
 
A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a a creamy but not syrupy beer. Finishes slightly sticky but not overly sweet

Pours completely pitch black with 3 fingers of dense dark tan head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing 
 
The maple honestly isn’t even the first thing that jumps out at me in the nose, opting for a thinner maple profile to support the other adjuncts. I’m picming up on aromas of dark roast coffee, sweet bourbon, milk chocolate, maple sap, burnt caramel, molasses, charred oak, and light vanilla 
 
It’s also not extremely maple in taste, but it is unfortunately a bit sweeter than the nose led me to believe. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting burnt caramel, dark roast coffee, black cherry, dark chocolate, maple syrup, vanilla, toasted oak, and light bourbon. The swallow brings notes of maple syrup, milk chocolate, medium roast coffee, black cherry, raisin, vanilla, toasted oak, and sweet bourbon

The taste is very fruity and juicy, like a perfect refined, orange juice, with a hint of dank Ness, and an abundance of tropical notes but all very muted. Light and foamy, feeling body, very smooth! I’ve been anticipating this brew for a long time I got it at beer hub in Waynesville North Carolina and I’m drinking in Maggie Valley August 12, 2023.

Intense tart cherry smell and taste with warm spice flavors and a nice earthy funk. Enjoyed it very much!

Montmorency Vs Balaton,"A: pours up a murky reddish grape hue, with a quickly receding, white, one finger head. 
S: Immediate, cherries and notes of funk and tannic oak. There is something here also that comes off a bit like sugary cereal. 
T: Surprisingly subdued, it is sour, but not brutally so, and the cherry is certainly there but I got some baking spice, what seems like cinnamon in the finish and definite (although more subtle) funk . There are also some other more subtle notes of dark fruit and oaky tannins. 
M: surprisingly full, but still bone dry. 
O: This is an interesting beer, it is much more subtle, nuanced and complex than I was expecting it to be. Full disclosure, I’m not a real kriek/Cherry sour fan, so I bought this on reputation alone and while I don’t think my mind has been changed about kriek, I do think this beer is more than the sum of its parts and has some nice complexity to offer. I think the risk and often the temptation with a flavor as big and assertive as cherry is to let it do all the heavy lifting because it tends to be such a people pleaser on its own. Fruited Sour beer has never been my thing and it’s still not, but I will say that if more these beers handled their subject with the grace and restraint on display here, I would be more inclined to buy them.",3.96

Grey Monday,"2021 vintage 
 
I’m an absolute sucker for hazelnuts in a Stout, and when I see that The Bruery has one, it’s an instant buy. Plus it’s also another top 250 list tick. This is a big ass bottle that I’ll likely be attacking all night so let’s stop wasting time and get right into it 
 
Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of light tan head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing 
 
Right off the jump, there isn’t much hazelnut present in the nose, but it’s still interesting nonetheless. I’m picking up on aromas of molasses, earthy bourbon, peat smoke, sea salt, cocoa powder, toasted hazelnut, dry oak, light vanilla, and raisin 
 
The hazelnuts definitely express a bit more in taste, though they still aren’t exactly at the forefront. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting cocoa powder, earthy bourbon, toasted hazelnut, toasted oak, black cherry, burnt caramel, vanilla, sea salt, and smoky tobacco. The swallow brings notes of dark chocolate, earthy bourbon, toasted hazelnut, sea salt, peat smoke, sea salt, molasses, dry oak, burnt caramel, and light vanilla 
 
A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes mostly dry and drinks significantly below its abv. Like literally less than half and that’s easily the most impressive part of this one 
 
I struggle with this one. It’s definitely not top 250 material, and the adjunct isn’t really the star, but on the other hand it’s (dangerously) drinkable and pretty unique. Worth a shot for sure",4.31
Grey Monday,"750mL bottle, 2021 edition sent to new Society members under their new nationwide shipping policy. Very little difference from the base Black Tuesday, if I'm honest, having had regular BT many times but this being my first Grey Monday. That means it's excellent, but the hazelnut treatment is pretty muted at this point (if it was ever more prominent), yielding a slight generic nuttiness with a touch of additional sweetness. It's not Nutella, that's for sure. It also suffers the same shortcomings of the standard BT, being very thin on mouthfeel for the ultra-high ABV and pretty hot on bourbon heat once it warms up a bit.",4.2
Grey Monday,,3.96
Grey Monday,,4.41
Grey Monday,"Pours a very dark brown though with moderate light clarity on the edges. Fizzy cola head that quickly dissipates to a thin ring. Nose has a hint of hazelnuts right off the bat before giving way to big waves of whiskey and rum, molasses, dark soy sauce, barley, oyster sauce, and vanilla. Flavor is a little tough to place. Heat - both warming booze and sharp ethanol - pop right away. There's significant salinity that's different from Black Tuesday - less deep, blackstrap molasses, more brackish sea spray or even oysters. Malts, soy sauce, black licorice are there, but with less intensity than BT. The nuts come forward as it warms, and though it's hard to definitively place hazelnuts, they would be a guess along with peanuts and hazelnuts - definitely nothing too fatty like a walnut. Mouthfeel is remarkably thin for this kind of beer (I'd call it ""moderate""), especially when compared to BT or a BCBS. That's not bad per se, but I think the feel contributes to the overall heat and sharpness. This was interesting - though I'm not sure I'd be keen to shell out for another bottle.",3.76

Not much lacing, either. I like the aroma, the brew smells like bourbon, vanilla, fudge, hazelnuts, brown sugar and roasted malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some burnt/charred malt, caramel and earthy/oaky flavors. It's a little more roasty/bitter tasting than I was expecting, but that's not a complaint by any means. All the flavors seemed well balanced with no one flavor overpowering the others. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick and a bit rich with a moderate amount of carbonation. And as with most of the Bruery's big beers, it's not as boozy as you'd expect it to be.

Not he, just a thin, broken band around the shoulders. Nose is robust - big hit of figs, followed by ethanol and perhaps a trace of oxidation/soy sauce in the background. Taste consistent with nose - figs are a bit more candied in the flavor profile. Middle is earthy with a suggestion of chocolate and finishes with prunes and a light medicinal bitterness.

Great,"2013 vintage; consumed on 3/23/2022 
 
Pours a stunning pitch-chestnut, an almost inky appearance giving way to slight ruby accents as a bubbly half-finger of pale tan head forms, slowly fizzing out to a sparse cap, expansive, frothing collar, and no lacing clinging to the walls of the glass. 
 
Aroma offers immediate impressions of jammy plum, refining focus to fig, subtle caramel, and toffee over time as an evocative, dark fruit overload springs forth across the bouquet; bourbon on the back end encourages a touch of cherry and lighter cocoa to engage the close. 
 
Taste opens to layers of sugar plum, raisin, dates, and bits of brown sugar, growing in accents of bold fig and burnt caramel into the mid-palate; oaky vanilla meets fruitcake on the back end, while leathery chocolate dusts a barrel edge, with slight bourbon and smoked toffee finishing. 
 
Mouthfeel shows a medium body, dense and concentrated silky textures foundational beneath a low-lying carbonation; smooth, wispy grit guides to a mild twang underscoring a vague, burgeoning oxidation into mid-palate, followed by a mild barrel char and steady warmth on the back end, with some stickiness into the otherwise velvety finish. 
 
Belying most any sense of experiencing time and age, this is a rich, comprehensive American barleywine; a deft composition of ultra-bold fruits, calm barrel inflection, and leathery resins encapsulating a consuming, classic apex of the style.",4.44

Art,"A: The decanter tinges vermilion on the initial impact, which transfers to a vivid – metallic – orange. That luminosity tops a deep saffron base with a pastel orange hue, as gamboge tones streak throughout. Proportionately, an askew cap that comes to a vista white inch, while steadily downsizing to the ½ in, where the palette succumbs a snow drift highlight. The configuration has the hydrophobic polypeptides & bitter acids to modestly cling, when retreating to the ¼ in. At this point, a latticework with a residual nuance to dimly stick, as the retention retains an enacting solidity. Albeit, shy on the aesthetic decree, seeing the descending collar to the minute. The layouts have a transparency upon the transfers, which have an opulent appeal early on, while a circuitous convention develops amid the pressing radiations 
 
S: A density set to esters, as they constantly web around the oak casks, while the grain bill pitches a smart rusticity. There is an isoamyl octanoate innuendo near the persuasive peach accompaniments, which takes a Torani Syrup form. In this respect, a softly tart & fuzzy recording that’s lightly backed, by the oak tannin exchanges, while the hop effect lends a floral regularity. The phenolic compounds gradually characterize on cobwebs, aside a ripened mustiness, given the vintage works over the decant. However, a narrow presentation on the inaugurating course, as the directive is more symphonic to the seeds and skins above the alluding crops. The advancements have a stronger denotation on the aged strains with a grain bill that ties in pit + trench silos, while maintaining a profitable presence on esters. Markedly, a harmonization amongst the ranching & pastoral foregrounds to the milder fruits ascribing pears, berries, and apricots. Moreover, an undercroft ease on the °F upticks, while a dry Torrontés similitude dispatches, besides the barrel aldehydes. The cessations retain an earthed ruralism against the – loitering – eugenol structures, beyond the leathery tannin constitutes 
 
T: Fermentable complexities with a soft cask neatness, which traits ethyl acetates to porous oak codas. Namely, an oxidized kindliness that has a solvent growth under fresh clingstone peaches, which impute seedy connotations per the inferred pits. The French oak barrel offers mild spices to complex polymers, where phenolic aldehydes pitch vanillin. Meanwhile, malt backs the bready accounts with Dorset knobs & pie crusts, as hops back a longleaf pine essence, while ketones casually mingle. Chiefly, an inducement on raspberry ketones alongside strawberries & melons, before connoting emerald drop pluots. A buildout on fleshed fruit to palm syrup, as catacomb dust delicately descends on Golden Silk Spiders. Coupled with, cattle yard atmospheres to leathery tannins, as a transferred aridity elevates above the rustic granularities. The timing to weather – over the course – reverberates that inaugurating solvency thru an Oloroso Sherry implementation, which offers an oxidative nuttiness to exotic thickets. On the rear side, a perceptible murmur on cloves & nutmeg, while guaiacols quietly coat the codicils over smoke, as polyphenol compounds dictate 
 
M: There is a passing rain to flagstone texture, from a minerality component that later transcends on seafronts. The surface is soft with calm acidic natures, given the modest vivacities, which attenuate steadily. In consequence, a dry formation that benefits over the cask scriptures, when depicting the hydrolysable substances 
 
O: Yeast grandiosities that are perceptively backed across the bitter – earthy – hop effects, while phenolic companions lurk. On balance, a sensitive malt mannerism with a loyal intention to not annihilate the course, as the French oak barrels impress. The timetables are advantageous to the vintage over an improved dryness, from cut sugars to cranked up/interconnected esters",4.49

I don’t buy much Other Half, since by the time it makes it to my area it’s usually a few months old. That being said, Tavour has been getting me back into them lately with relatively fresh cans. Admittedly, I should’ve gotten around to this one sooner since I’ve had it for a few weeks, but I’m excited to try it regardless. Let’s get into it 
 
Pours a cloudy orange gold with 3 fingers of soapy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing 
 
The nose is vibrant and tropical, but there’s a nice bitter hop character to it as well. I’m picking up on aromas of orange juice, lemon zest, overripe cantaloupe, floral hops, bready malt, gooseberry, dank weed, dried blueberry, and light grass 
 
And it manages to keep up that wonderful balance in taste too thankfully. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting overripe cantaloupe, pineapple juice, bready malt, grassy hops, blueberry candy, dank weed, and light orange zest.

Hazy pale orange juice with little head and lacing. Hoppy citrusy scents of orange and pineapple, slightly tangy and dank.

A: Pous crystal clear, copper in color, moderate sized bright white head dissipates quickly leaving no lacing. Looks still in the glass’s 4.25 
 
S: Aroma is immediate raspberries, hay and raw wheat. Initially quite floral which then cedes to funky notes of slightly pungent cheese. I can’t say that it smells particularly sour, but there’s some lactic tartness and citrus rind. Quite complex and a wonderful nose. 4.75 
 
T: Taste follows with a big plastic like funk up front, which quickly yields to floral and citrus notes, with big oaky vanilla on the finish that lingers forever. Taste is quite tart and sour but it’s not as puckering as many lambics. The raspberry characters are present but certainly not prominent, not sure to what extent that’s due to the age. 4.5 
 
M/D: Mouthfeel is lighter side of medium bodied with a big but appropriate carbonation and incredible drinkability. I could drink this all day. 5 
 
O: A wonderful beer no doubt. Not sure if it was worth the difficulty in obtaining as I think I prefer Cantillon Rose de Gabrinus when it comes to Raspberry lambics (and I’ve surprisingly found the other easy to get over the years). Regardless, still wonderful and I would have a fridge full of this on the regular if it was readily available. 4.5",4.6

Aroma has a huge minerality, only mild lactic tartness, subtle pungent funk, not much fruit. Taste is burnt plastic like funk, some bitterness, moderate tart sourness, blueberries are subtle. I poured the sedimentation in a separate mini glass, it has huge blueberry aromas and was much sweeter and richer, a blueberry cobbler character almost. The taste was a little more tart and a little more blueberry forward but still not a ton. Ok back to the main pour. As it warms it opens up a bit like a good wine. Fruit comes out a bit, and lactic acidity builds but still never reaches the mouth puckering tartness of most Cantillons. It’s very clean, crispy even, with a high but appropriate carbonation and very good drinkability. Overall, a very nice beer. Is it worth the hype/hoops one needs to jump through to obtain it?

Light touching head, with ultra fine bright white bubbles. Lots of pill like lacing and even leggy. Island creamy top with a soft shape, sitting on a slightly hazed dark lemon, with hints of noticeable fast rising carbonation. 
 
A bold nose. Dank hits of earth and must hop, but also a real tropical passionfruit like flavor. Hits nice and spicy too, with a bevy of hop explosive power. Nice and diverse but just misses the wow factor, and other beer character balance. 
 
Palate is just real nice. Juiced up and filled with a rich malt coating, hop flavoring of passionfruit, pineapple, and a real jammy like texture. Coats a little chalky but also brings a real nice spicy earthy hop bitterness on the finish. Good notes of tropical variety too, guava, mango all sorts of fruit tropical goodness.

Framboos,"I picked this up last week at Vintage Estates wine and beer in Boardman OH. My favorite beer store. This 375 ml was very expensive but I have been after this beer for 15 years. Also got Hommage and may save that for beer rating/review #2k. Bottled on 18 Dec 2019. 
 
A- Body is a uniformly hazy orange with a hint of pink. Perhaps sunset in color. There is no head or lacing to speak of. 
 
S- The nose is complex yet simple. Tart raspberries, cheesecloth, funk, oak barrel, breadiness. 
 
T- The flavor is much like the nose- sweet and tart authentic raspberries upfront with a light bready yeast backbone. The finish is quite sour but a softness from the oak barrel lingers on with some sourness long after you swallow. 
 
F- Medium carbonation and a medium weight body. There is a lot of acidity in the body with a light bread yeast feel too. 
 
O- This beer is truly world class. It's the definition of a traditional fruit lambic and it is brewed so carefully and so well. It definitely gets better and you appreciate it more as it goes down. It's quite expensive so if you don't like more traditional sours or you don't like raspberries than don't bother.",4.32

F: Good fizzy carbonation and medium body.

This detracts from the overall flavor profile. Moderate tartness. Moderate funk. Nice fruit. Overall it's solid but not something I'd feel the need to buy again.

Light Beer,"First off I don't like any light beers. I'm a Guinness Stout guy. However, I'll concede there's times when a heavier brew isn't the thirst quencher of choice. Like when the temp soars in the nineties and you would just about drink water as your preferred thirst quencher. That's is a time for light beer and this ones is about as un-offensive as it gets. It reminds me of Keystone for those times....at an even better price. It's really light tasting. Not too much adjunct taste or hops bitterness. It really quinces a thirst. It's easy to drink period. For a basement priced brew for those who want to quaff it down this stuff rules. I think it gets no love first because of the segment and second because of the price. Really? What are we reviewing here. For the segment it competes in, and at the price it goes for, this is a singularly good product. I know it's like the third or whatever generation of Kirklands offerings in the light beer segment. I think it's good enough that they should settle on this on and offer it indefinitely.",2.43

Light Beer,"A: Pours a crystal clear pale yellow in color with moderate amounts of active visible carbonation rising quickly from the bottom of the glass and faint pale golden yellow colored highlights. The beer has a finger tall fizzy bright white head that quickly reduces to a small patch of very thin film and a very thin ring at the edges of the glass. Minimal amounts of lacing are observed. 
 
S: Moderate aromas of grainy malts with moderate amounts of corn adjunct sweetness and just a hint of grassy hops. 
 
T: Upfront there are just shy of moderate flavors of grainy malts with moderate amounts of rice + corn adjuncts along with a light amount of corn sweetness. That is followed by very light flavors of grassy hops which contribute a light to moderate amount of lingering bitterness. 
 
M: Light bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Crisp. 
 
O: While not a style that I generally seek out, this beer was not offensive like some of the other budget offerings in the style. Easy to drink with a crisp, light mouthfeel and well hidden alcohol. I would not go out of my way to seek this out again but I was pleasant surprised.

You know how in restaurants, when you order a soda water, they bring it to you with a slice of lime? This beer tastes exactly like that. A lime citrus taste. It's not unpleasant and is probably really nice on a hot day after hours of back-breaking work.

If it was closer in taste to, say, Pabst Blue Ribbon, or even as low as Coors Light, I'd give 5 stars across board but it's not even close. On the plus side, the price for the quantity is unbeatable and I will most likely continue to purchase this beer and it's hangovers because of this, as well as how good the company treats its customers.",1.06

Pours completely pitch black with a finger of light tan head that fades to ring and leaves minimal lacing 
 
Yeah it really is similar to the base beer in the nose, just bolder. I’m picking up on aromas of sweet maple, medium roast coffee, dark chocolate, toffee, smoky bacon, and burnt caramel 
 
It definitely tastes fuller, and in turn less abrasive than its base. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting sweet maple, light roast coffee, cocoa powder, black cherry, salty bacon, and light caramel. The swallow brings notes of maple syrup, smoky bacon, burnt caramel, medium roast coffee, tobacco, brown sugar, and light vanilla 
 
A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes mostly dry with a balanced sweetness

This is from a six pack of 10.4 oz (330ml?) green bottles with no date - maybe stored badly? Additionally - mine says 5% ABV, not the 4.5% that others report.

The taste is where Schaefer Light shines above it's brethren. It leaves absolutely no aftertaste at all, finishing clean and crisp. Extremely clean, absolutely refreshing. Medium carbonation, great mouthfeel, and completely enjoyable. 
 
I know it's cliche or chic to say how much of this you consumed in college when your tastes were unrefined or that it's the worst beer in existence, but Schaefer Light is actually a great tasting, refreshing, value beer perfect for a 90 degree day, or when you want to put many back and don't feel like crushing a huge IPA with an ABV over 8.

XXXX Gold,During my visit to Queensland I fell in love with XXXX Gold. Now that I am back in the United States I can't find this beer anywhere. If it is available in the states someone please let me know.,5
XXXX Gold,"XXXX Gold. The midstrength heart and soul of Australia's. Yo'Yo's with VB as the nations most popular beer, but in Queensland, it's holy water. I've personally never liked it, too watery, too thin, too tasteless. But today, I'm going to take my beer goggles off, drop my snobbery,ayour thirst quickly, easily, with no fuss, and not get you too smashed up in the unforgiving tropical heat that is Queensland.  
 
Look - 2.5/5: The iconic gold can, referred to as a Mango in Queensland (drinking out of the can is known as 'sucking on a mango') is pretty Iconic. And you gotta admit, bright yellow can, Australia, sunshine, happiness.  
Poured into a standard Ikea tumbler, rough pour, an extremely filtered, clear golden colour. Slightly darker than the can itself. Frothy bubbly white soapsuds head, it's a classic Aussie adjunct.  
 
Smell - 2.25/5: Corn, Wet grassy hops and bitterness, provided by the Pride of Ringwood obviously, some light biscuit malt. I've smelt this time and time and time again, mix and match any Aussie adjunct lager.  
 
Taste 2/5 - Cereal grain, light bitterness from the hops, light maltiness, watery, almost like I'm drinking a flavoured sparkling mineral water, beer flavoured mineral water with a slight chemical aftertaste.  
 
Feel: 2.25/5 - Highly carbonated, watery, thin, but on a 35 degree, 80% plus humidity day up in Far North Queensland, that's what you need.  
 
Overall: Outside of Queensland, the Northern Territory, or North-Western Western Australia, this is a terrible, terrible beer. I know it's a midstrength lager, but hell, even Great Northern Super Crisp has a better overall flavour than XXXX Gold.  
However in those aforementioned months, particularly during the summer months of the year, this is an excellent brew. It's thin, crisp enough, highly quaffable, and being a 3.5% beer, you can drink a few of them and still be in a condition to do stuff afterwards. And that's where and when I'll accept XXXX Gold as an acceptable beverage. Because those are the conditions this beer is brewed for. You wouldn't go drinking a super thick IIPA, or a stout in those conditions, no. And you shouldn't be drinking this in the Snowy Mountains of NSW in the depths of Winter (unless you were driving, you were being sensible, and there's no other light-mid option). To me it's always tasted like a beer flavoured mineral water.",2.14

No surprises in the taste. Light flavours, it is 3.5%abv, of corn/grain, tiny malt sweetness, low presence of hoppy bitterness. Served cold cuz I reckoned that would put it at its optimum.  
 
Pretty decent mouthfeel considering.

An Australian domestic made for the working class, sitting at 3.5% and 375ml, which equals 1 “standard” drink. Allowing people to manage their alcohol intake at places where you need to drive, out in the bush, the beach, the pub home after work, this beer is extremely popular because it targeted a demographic of people on the move.  
 
Goes down best with fish and chips from your local, or after mowing the lawn on a hot and humid Aussie day ice cold. 3.5% means it lacks much punch however, it can feel a bit watery as well as lack carbonation from time to time. Clear, bright and orangy-yellow, one finger of head when poured, however due to my fondness of this domestic drop, I prefer I straight out of the dark bottle, its just an icon of suburban Brisbane. Not a classy beer but a well mapped and demographically targeted beer that’s just very average. It is popular here for a reason!!",3.12

Had the original plenty of times though I haven't seen it in quite some time..but maybe that's because I haven't looked for it considering High Life is always my go to cheapy. The word "" Ice "" I almost always another way to say "" hangover imminent "". Lets do it. 
 
Looks the part. Clear yellow, big white eggshell head with a shit load of carbonation. Nothing left after a finished glass. 
 
Chemical comes to mind on the nose with fair hints of alcohol. Adjuncts are all there as expected. Creamed corn dominant. 
 
Taste luckily loses the chemical factor. Thank Satan, thought this was about to be another Labatt maximum Ice disaster ( The worst disaster since 9/11 ). Adjuncts amp up, hillybilly asshole level corniness. 
 
Feel is rather sticky, sweet and corny with a super level of carbonation. Swallows with a shallow alcoholic bite and leave your mouth dry as a transexuals vagina. 
 
Overall it's pretty average. The scent is a throw off, the feel is a bit odd but otherwise it's just your standard run of the mill brew. Probably not worth the imminent hangover.",2.41

Maybe the target customers really don't mind a lack of malt into their purchase decisions, and that's ok too. Like roaches and spiders cheap beer has it's place in the overall scheme of things.

Taiwan Beer,"Poured from an undated 12oz can into a pils glass 
 
On the pour a 2 finger head that pokes out of the top of the glass forms then slowly recedes to a rocky slightly fizzy head then to just a covering over thentop after 10 or so minutes. Body is a light golden straw with a very light chill haze. 
 
Aroma is incredibly light and very clean. Based off the aroma alone and the inclusion of rice as the only adjunct I disagree with the current AAL classification and believe this is much closer to a Japanese Rice Lager. Light hops are present and a very light but clean lager yeast note. Malts are quite light and what is there is rice crackery. 
 
Taste is very similar to the smell again very light, but insanely clean and detectably hoppy. Everything about this is light but the hops are floral and fruity woth almost zero bitterness and the yeast notes are light dry and again vaguely fruity. The finish is where the malt comes in and it is very light and crackery with rice lightness present, but the rice itself doesn't contribute much to the flavor. Once the beer warms a bit there is a bit of a dirty lager finish but it takes a while for it to set in and doesn't cover the good parts of this beer. 
 
Feel is light and very dry with a decent carbonation bite. Very refreshing and drinkable but the mouthfeel is incredibly dry. Not the softest beer in the mouth, a bit of a fizzy feeling. Finish Is medium long but clean. 
 
Overall this is an impressive Asian beer. More than just another boring pale lager, it has some defining features, and a nice floral hoppy note. Very dry and surprisingly good. I only got it because I kept seeing it at total beverage and the can looked nice but this is actually impressive and memorable.",3.63

Very thin feel to the 4.5%. Finishes cold and fizzy albeit on the watery side. Grainy notes persist. Better in the can for certain as the less desirable mustiness is less noticeable.",3.01
Taiwan Beer,"Look - golden color, transparent, small head that dissipates, leaving virtually no lacing. 
Smell - syrupy sweetness, with some malts and rice fragrance. no skunkiness, and actually quite pleasant overall. 
Taste - unfortunately, the taste did not make up for the smell. fairly watery, no hops presence, and light malty flavor. finishes with slight sweetness, a strong indicator of the proportion of rice used in this brew. 
Feel - light bodied, high carbonation, on par with most adjuncts at 4.5% ABV.

Smell: A nasty aroma of stale hops and overcarbonation. This isn't looking good.  
 
Taste: Barely one note of light hops bleeding into a sharp finish. There's very little to say about this beer's taste. It's a bit like water with a beer flavour; in fact the main note is water. This beer is bland, uninspired, unambitious, and poorly built, even for the price.  
 
Mouthfeel: Wet and fizzy throughout. Unrefreshing. Neither smooth nor coarse, but discernably awful.  
 
Drinkability: At least it's a bit better than most American macro lagers. At this price range, if you're just looking to get intoxicated, you're better off going with Steel Reserve. This beer might taste better on the way up. If I weren't a broke student I wouldn't be having another.",1.67

Iron City Beer,"12oz bottle 
 
On a hard pour, 1 finger of white head forms then dissipates to a sporadic covering on top of a clear golden yellow body. Lacing attempts to form but fades to nothing. Average to decent AAL. 
 
Aroma is surprisingly malty with some corn and a mineralic crispness. Not a craft lager but for 9.00 a sixer this is decent. Not all that interesting but solid for the style and price. 
 
Taste is again better than expected, with the American lager yeast character being present but not offensive. Maltiness and corn is more subdued than expected from the aroma. Very clean but a bit boring. Super smooth. 
 
The feel is verging on light but that's what this beer is. There is a surprisingly medium-long finish. The beer is relatively dry and very drinkable.

When I swished the bottom and poured, some yeast chunks were seen in the foam, and the foam turned tan (at the top). The aroma is full- pungent, sweet, malty, and noticeable as soon as the cap is popped. The flavor is really strange. There is an overriding charcoal taste in the beer, so it has a pronounced rauchbier character. One will also pick up sweetness, barley malt, and hops, but the smoke is overriding. Mouthfeel is light to medium, and Golden Eagle Lager Beer finishes crisp, refreshing, and smoky. Overall, even with the bizarre nature, it is still quite good.

Carling Black Label,"Happy CANada Day, hosers! Take off, eh? This is one of my FAVORITE holidays of the year since it provides me with the impetus to a) drink CANned CANadian beer ISO The CANQuest (tm); b) watch hockey (either pre-recorded games or movies, like ""Slapshot""; c) watch ""Strange Brew""; d) eat some beaver & e) parade nekkid in the street while waving a CANdian flag. 2017 was their 150th Anniversary so I pulled out all of the stops, using sparklers & firecrackers as accoutrements, which was attention-getting, to say the least. The local CANstabulary was bemused & amused as they led me away, but I was less-than-thrilled with the 1st & 2nd degree burns, especially to my sensitive bits! Needless to say, I have scaled back since then.  
 
A BIG ""THANK YOU!"" to my local, in-person trading partner, @tone77 , for providing me with a buncha beers for today's CANebration! He said that many of them will take me back to the early days of The CANQuest (tm), when AALs were the standard & the norm. No matter! Today, we CANebrate & inebriate! Cheers to our CANuck neighbors! 
 
This beer really takes me back. It was ~ 1969 & my late-Pops was a hardcore unionist working at the now-defunct ALCOA plant. A strike was in the offing & so a meeting was held at my parents' house to decide a course of action. My 'rents, while not teetotalers, were not big imbibers so alcohol consumption was kind of a rarity. I was ~ 4 y/o at the time & curious, so when somebody offered me a sip from their CAN of Carling Black Label, Pops nodded in assent & I partook for the first time in my life. I CAN only remember being astounded by the bitterness of the hops just before I dropped the CAN from my hands, spilling it all over the carpet. Uproarious laughter ensued, except from Pops, who promptly escorted me to bed. LOL.  
 
I had ""O CANada"" playing on YouTube as I Crack!ed open the vent to begin this momentous CANebration.  
 
This reminds me of another story. I was a Plankowner aboard the USS Normandy (CG-60) in 1989 & when we opened the Staten Island Naval Shipyard in late-1990, I was a fixture at Rangers games @MSG. It was easy - flash my active duty ID, pay a pittance & sit in the infamous Blue Seats where the action happened. Beer was a given & if I got there early enough to where they were not sold out, a potato knish. Profanity was the native tongue up there & cocaine was openly snorted, but those are tales for another time. On this night, the TOR Maple Leafs were in town, necessitating the singing of both the U.S. & CANadian national anthems. I know the latter in both English et Français so I was singing along when I suddenly registered the voices behind me. Right tune, wrong words, or so I thought. After the anthems were done & we were seated, I donned my Curious Cat suit & turned to ask the guys behind me as to what had transpired. They were Spanish-speaking Latinos of Puerto RiCAN descent who had grown up in Hell's Kitchen & were lifelong Rangers fans. They had been to so many games that they sing the national anthems in SPANISH! I sat back, flabbergasted.  
 
Onward! I went with a nice, free-flowing Glug since this was such an auspicious ocCANsion, leading to the foamy formation of two-plus fingers of fizzy, foamy, rocky-bone-(Great) white (North) head, but with only moderate retention. 8=( Color was a pretty Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 - 5) with CANadian-quality clarity & now The Gelt Gang of Midas, Mammon & Croesus appeared to join the CANadian CANebration! Whotta party. Nose was actually not bad, when rating to style.  
 
The adjunct that mars most, if not all, AALs is the inclusion of corn. I have loved Fritos corn chips since Kindergarten when I first had them as a snack, but I do NOT like the taste of corn in beer. It is an extender that traces its roots to illicit beer being made during Prohibition when anything & everything was fair game as far as ingredients were CANcerned.  
 
Yes, there was a corn aspect to the nose, but I have encountered FAR worse with some like opening a bag of the aforementioned Fritos! 8=p This was on the low end of that f**ked-up spectrum. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was more innocuous than anything else. It was light in flavor to the point that adjuncts were more of an afterthought than something with which to be CANcerned. I was kind of surprised at just how flavorless this seemed to me to be. My palate, as a self-avowed, self-described hophead, seemed to have evolved to the point that AALs are rendered simply ethereal. Not bad, just not destined for Guy Fieri's ""Flavortown"". Finish was crisp, dry & refreshing on this hot, hazy, humid CANada Day, which is just what they were shooting for. Sure, it's a flawed beer, but the style itself is flawed. Remember, Rate to Style & NOT to Taste, boys & girls!",3.33

The taste is sticky sweet with some caramel and more apple/pear and tongue numbing ethanol. Negligible bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with just less that average carbonation and a decidedly undry finish.

The body is full and a bit oily, light carbonation.  
Altogether my first problem is rating this as any kind of pilsner, it just does not resemble any pilsner I've ever had. It is more like an extra strength barleywine or maybe a ""boilermaker"".

Look - Transparent yellow without a head and an assload of carbonation. No stick. 
 
Smell - Here's where things really get fun. Absolutely astringent in every sense of the word. All reference to beer was filtered from this thing and replaced with leftover industrial cleanser. 
 
Taste - If you've read the scent, you already understand the taste. Bitter as all get out to boot. 
 
Feel - Heavily carbonated like champagne on steroids and far too thick bodied for its own good. Swallow induces the gag reflex and nearly makes you spit up the beer. 
 
Overall - Absolutely atrocious in every sense of the word. Figured this was going to be another generic light lager without a frill that scored in the mid 2's and forgotten by tomorrow morning. Instead I will remember this for all the wrong reasons. A light lager...hell any adjunct lager style is supposed to be easy going and poundable without a care in the world. This thing fails in every single regard aside from maybe the appearance. Up there with steel reserve and labatt maximum ice in terms of worst tasting beers I've ever had the displeasure of consuming. Any other light lager you can grab at a supermarket is like a TIPA compared to this. Seriously. Even something as putrid as NATURAL ICE tastes like heaven compared to this.

Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,"Here is a brew I've been cellaring for quite a while as I feared it would taste rancid based on reviews of this site. Let me tell you maybe the bad reviews are due to drinking this too fresh or in the wrong glass or the wrong temperature or improper storage, I don't know. But I am drinking a bottle right now that has aged gracefully for 14 years and reminds me of nothing more than J.W. Lee's Barley wine, the only thing missing is some time in the barrel. 
 
Poured at about 44 degrees into a snifter this beer has an appearance of opaque orangish, rustic brown with minimal head. The aroma is of sweet hints of subtle wet cardboard and wet basement yet has some bourbon, caramel, vanilla, fruity woodness mixed in. The flavors are very much of the aroma with some hints of tobacco. I'm telling you if I didn't see the bottle I would have thought it was a J.W. Lee vintage. For $3 this beer kicks ass! It might just need to age and be stored properly. This is for sure the best Lithuanian beer I have ever had. I give it a 5 because well I see nothing wrong with it and if I see it again I'll be sure be buying it again. Think about it J.W. Lees is $10 for 11.2 oz and this is $3 for 22oz.",5

Notes via stream of consciousness: Cool label. I'm not sure what the santa hat is doing on a guy who looks kind of like the devil, but OK. And what is ""naturally fermented beer""? Is there an un-natural way of fermenting beer? I have not heard of that yet but I digress. It pours a clear amber-orange body beneath a short head of bright white that is fizzling away before my eyes. At 15% alcohol though I guess that a little of that is expected. Ahhh, wait, although it's clear, not quite fingerprint-through-the-glass clear, but clear, the bottle says it's ""partially filtered, bottle-conditioned"" and maybe that's what they mean by ""naturally fermented beer"". Unfortunately partially filtered is not the same thing as bottle-conditioned, and I highly doubt you'd get much additional carbonation at 14+% alcohol unless you had a really tolerant yeast strain, but OK, here I go getting off-track again, back to the beer. There's some higher alcohol and ethyl acetate in the aroma. Not good. There's some adjunct laden and bready & caramelish malt as well but the nail polish aroma is distracting - big loss of points on that count. Of course, to be honest, I was kind of expecting that. This isn't from Russia, it's from Lithuania, but that's close enough and I've found a lot of the beers from the Baltic region with higher gravities and alcohol contents suffer from hot and fast fermentations. Personally I believe that they actually like this over there, but different strokes for different folks, right? At least it doesn't taste like anti-freeze was added, that's pretty much soley a Russian thing. Moving forward, and if you think I was kidding I wasn't, the flavor reflects those higher alcohols and ethyl acetate as well. It's not the worst I've ever had but it's still not good. I'm only a couple of sips into this and I'm not sure I want to finish it. I fear I might black out, or maybe do something weird if I get drunk on it. It's malty though, and at least I like that; and it's balanced by a low-level bitterness and the hot alcohol which equals a dry finish. There are, unfortunately, no noticeable hops. Perhaps some leafy, grassy, and spicy undertones are there but that's it. No, this is more like the malt prior to distilling Bourbon. Given that it's flawed it's hard to score it well, but at the same time I have had worse so it is what it is, and it gets what it gets. Medium-full in body with a dextrinous side and a moderate, soft carbonation that leaves it smooth and doesn't amplify the alcohol or heat that's there. Not the best by any means, but certainly not undrinkable.",3.23
Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,"The look is that of a Samuel Adams Boston lager. The smell and taste is basically the same. Decent beer that has been sitting in a rusty bucket, it even slightly stings. THE FEEL!!!! This is where this beer shines. When you consider the alcohol content, it is so light and easy to drink. It has the alcohol of four beers and comes in 16.6oz bottles! 
It doesn't taste like one of those iced beers, it's not thick, it won't make you puke if you chug it(which has happened to me with King Cobra and Natty Daddy). If you put a little thought, and calculate the amount of alcohol in this drink, the taste and feel are far better than anything else in the range. I will definitely buy again.",5

The taste, though, is awful: cloyingly sweet with astringent alcohol; there's nothing subtle about this . . . and nothing good, either. It's bereft of carbonation and the booziness is over the top.

what I can add from memory: don't know what I was thinking, but I gotta lower the marks for smell and taste, as its initial aromas (and they eventually vaped off) were truly off-putting... aside from its introductory stench, Lone Star is a pretty basic adjunct lager, but on the lower end of its echelon... only a when-in-Texas thing I guess (2031)",3.11
Lone Star Beer,"Drank from the can. Date on can: Dec 05 2022. 
 
Other reviewers have already summed up the vibe: clear, yellow, fizzy, perhaps a bit darker than your typical American adjunct. Aroma is sweet grains, corn, bread and yeast with a bitter, grassy hoppiness. Taste follows the nose well. Very reminiscent of Coors for me, with a clean mouthfeel and solid flavor for the style with a bit more balance than most adjuncts, which tend to be too sweet. I quite enjoy the body of this one, it's not as thin and ultra carbonated as a Pabst Blue Ribbon, actually has a tiny bit of chewiness. 
 
Figured I had to try this while I'm living in Texas and it actually slightly exceeded my expectations. Coors was my previously highest rated American adjunct macro, and I think this one might slightly edge it out due to a better aroma, but it's very close. This isn't something I would pick up routinely unless I was in a monetary bind, as it is priced quite modestly, but it certainly gets the job done, most especially on a hot summer day.

Nose is malty, and somewhat one note - rye bread. This is what I get, and I get a lot of it.

It is reminiscent of some high malt lagers I’ve had, Kirin Ichiban comes to mind. Bready with corn aroma and flavor coming out as it warms. Mouthfeel is light and clean but not crisp.

All good things come to an end. After 8-10 six-packs I got tired of the taste and moved on to other brews. I remember the store clerk telling me that they had Blatz Beer on sale for xx dollars. Didn't matter, I was tired of the beer.",3.47

Blatz Beer,Blatz is a well rounded beer that goes down easy. Under rated I believe because of its limited availability.,3.66
Blatz Beer,"Hard to find around me . Usually pick it up at reisbacks in zanesville oh . My uncle's drank the hell out of this back in the 80s . Kind of sweet an light bodied for a non lite aal. Just has a better taste than some of my other cheap go -tos. Like I said , you just don't see it around central Ohio everyday , and it's always the cans , you never see the little brown bottles anymore.",3.46

Blatz Beer,"Pours a standard translucent gold with a fluffy white head that's thinner than expected and dissipates relatively quickly. It smells slightly sweet, but has a very thick barley forward smell with a hint of grassy hops and a touch of wet corny sweetness. The taste is fuller than expected with a bigger malt presence than most and has a slightly hoppy edge to keep it from being sweet. It's thicker feeling without being thick like a Schlitz or a non adjuncted lager. It goes down like a light lager but it's not. Overall the sum is greater than it's parts on this one. Pick it up if you want to drink something you've never had before.",3.8
Blatz Beer,"At fifty cents per can, Blatz is a fine COVID-19 low-cost adult beverage. Decent light lager taste, good carbonation. Expect this to be a great summer quaff",3.34
Blatz Beer,"Drank from a 12 ounce can. Scores are based on the style. 
 
Look - The logo is incredibly attractive, but the can as an ensemble isn't that great. The silver color doesn't draw me in, and the tessellated little Blatz words across the can just clutter things up. 
 
Smell - Very faint metallic sweetness. Maybe some grape? Not much there. 
 
Taste - The first thing that comes to mind is cream soda. Somewhat vanilla sweetness, but even with its lightness, it still begs for some bitterness to round it out. 
 
Feel - Thin body with a pleasant amount of fizz. Goes down quite easy. 
 
Overall - I was hoping to find a new hipster-y grandpa beer to love, but this one is pretty lame. Not bad nor good, I don't know when I'll get back to it after this.",3.03

Old Milwaukee Light,Old Mil has a beer I drank when I was in college because of the price when I was in college was 9 bucks a case and as I have got older its made a resurgence in my area after being on a single case stack at the local beer store they now carry it by the pallet. This beer is extremely smooth and to many drinkers tastes like beer nothing offensive but does not blow you away. can basically copy and paste this to the Old MIl premium but no point to go with premium due to no noticeable taste difference and just higher calories. EDIT REVIEW. this beer has replaced Busch Light as my go to beer combination of flavor and cost. There is a reason that this product has won so many award and is the most award winning light beer regardless of hipsters and fanboys wanting to trash it because it is a (Cheaper) beer. People need to realize that just because a beer costs more does not mean it is better.,3.97

It did have a sort of a weird smell that made me think I might be drinking something possibly sweet but once it hitmy tongue all that disappeared.  
The only thing impressive about this is that it would make a decent beer to serve for the purposes of a movie that required a bubbly drink with a thick head. It bubbles with a thick gooey foam that just lingers in a frightful manner given the horrible taste. After smelling and tasting this swill I began to wonder if the foam was part of some spoilage feature.

Head settles eventually to a nice film layer of surface foam and there is some pretty good lacing in the inside of the glass too after a few sips. Aromas of some bready malt sweetness along w/ what's likely corn and rice and not much else. Not the best aroma by any means, but not unpleasant or offensive either. The taste is pretty much the same, some bready, malt sweetness followed by rice and corn and just a slight hint of hop bitterness. As I get a few more sips into this and as this starts to warm up a bit, I'm starting to taste an unpleasant grassy, cardboard, metallic bitter like off flavor of some sort. Also a touch of hops. Has a crisp and also smooth, medium bodied mouthfeel w/ moderate carbonation. That unpleasant grassy, metallic bitterness taste lingers on my palate after each sip.

I would urge all of you to keep rating it under 2.5 so it will never become cool and always be affordable.",3.54

Minhas Light,"Poured from a can into a pint glass 
 
Appearance – The beer pours a light golden color with a fizzy white head. The head fades super fast leaving almost no lace on the sides of the glass.  
 
Smell –The aroma of the brew is mostly of a corn smell mixed with a little bit of a musty aroma.  
 
Taste-The taste begins with a sweeter corn syrup taste mixed with a little bit of a grain. As the taste moves on some lighter flavors of caramel and even more corn come to the tongue. In the end one is left with a somewhat more sweet corn cereal taste to linger on the tongue. 
 
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is very thin and light with a carbonation level that is rather average. The thin body is prime for the sweeter and subdued tastes of the brew. A little higher carbonation would have been slightly better for the lightness of the brew, but even so, the feel was alright overall. 
 
Overall – For a 4% abv. brew that clocks in at only ~95 calories I am not going to expect a flavor powerhouse. Nothing is really off in the taste, but nothing is really on either. It is sort a standard light brew overall.",2.6

Bard's Gold,"Date: 2/16/21; I am not seeking a gluten-free beer. However, having a family member who cannot drink beer because of gluten; having produced sorghum from sugar cane in a previous job; and knowing that sorghum has a smell and viscosity similar to canned malt from previous brews, this beer piqued my interest. When pouring from the can, I was surprised by the light color since sorghum has a dark amber hue. I was disappointed with the head, which quickly disappeared (apparently a trait of malt-free beverages). I began to think I was drinking a Bud-light. I was wrong. The smell had a hint of sorghum, nothing powerful since there was no head to capture it. The taste was subtle, but having a palate for IPA's, this is what I expected. First sip to last, I enjoyed this beer. The second can was as good as the first. I imagine I would enjoy it more on a warm summer day after cutting the lawn.",3.35
Bard's Gold,"Tonight I had my first Bard's Gold and I am pleasantly surprised. My first thought is this is exactly what Michelob Light or Bud Light should taste like and if I remember, both beers used to taste better, but now taste like water especially Bud Light. It had a nice bold taste, good flavor, and sits well with my dinner. This is a new beer at my liquor store and I'll be buying it again.",5

Bard's Gold,"DATE: March 28, 2020.... OCCASION: two weeks into the COVID-19 quarantine, still (mostly) gluten-free, I measure a beer shared by my Coors Light-loving friend Billy... GLASSWARE: 22oz. pilsner... pours a tawny, sallow, champagne-tinged body with active effervescence... its head does the usual malt-free disappearing act, though its bubbles continue to rise and disperse at the weight of air... really not appealing in this light... immediate sorghum, hard fruits like apple, banana and pear, candied sugars, cosmetic counter perfume overload and a base solvency... nothing really alluring here, unless you dig cider or sorghum... its first sip is dry, thin, nearly lifeless (watery) and without fanfare... a late bubble in the throat may suggest its intentions, but it doesn't muster much beyond a thin rinse... I turn to Billy, and his reaction suggest Coors Light has not been approximated... the flavor is constantly ebbing, with faint hints of berry, apple, sorghum, cheerio, and bubblegum fluttering in and out of the picture, elusively if not frustratingly so... its singular profile doesn't leave much else to say, so I end with a simple disclaimer: if you have already enjoyed malted beer in any form, there's no need to dance with this one.... if you are a Celiac sufferer, maybe these will grow on you... all the same, cider might be a better option...",1.56
Bard's Gold,"The smell reminds me of a gluten beer I had many years ago, but really can't put my finger on it - an amber ale or an english, or Epic Pale Ale? The mouthfeel and actual taste are not very beer-like overall. Candy syrup, possibly molasses, but not much flavour. The telltale sorghum astringency is there which slowly builds up as I drink. You'd probably get used to this overall if you drank it a lot.  
 
For a sorghum beer, the sorghum is pretty well masked. Drinking multiple beers in a single session is the real test, but not sure I'll be up for the challenge. This is probably preferable to cider, but overall feels like a weird soft drink. As I live in Australia, I had to buy a whole box to get my hands on this. Hmm.",2.55

Bard's Gold,"I recently tasted Bard's Gold, a lager. I'm an avid beer drinker and have been trying to reduce the amount of gluten in my diet so I did a taste test of all the gluten-free beers on the market. Bards was the best of the lot. It is important to note that many of the competitors in the ""gluten free"" space are not truly gluten-free...they have ""warning labels"" that say they have been brewed to remove gluten...after a bit of research it appears that these beers use an enzyme to break down the gluten protein so the gluten can't be found in a test...but the gluten parts are still in the beer. I don't fully understand the science, but if there are parts of gluten present, it seems like misrepresented marketing to me??? Bards is made with malted sorghum (which doesn't contain gluten) and not wheat or barley (which contain gluten) like many beers. Looks like AB has a gluten-free sorghum beer too but it is made with a syrup and not the malted grain...we all know how important malting is to the beer's taste!  
 
My body feels so much healthier as I eliminate and reduce the gluten in my diet and am glad that I found Bards. I'm looking forward to drinking more Bards in the near future!",4.42

So I am contacting you, wondering is it possible, to order the Golden Champale (original ) in the green bottles. You should really consider , putting them in the green bottles. I know for some reason the color of those bottles, make a difference. Take a survey among your Champale drinkers, and see what you come up with .",1.25
Champale Golden,"24 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 7/23/2018. Pours crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a foamy soda off white head with poor retention, that reduces to a nothing very quickly. No glass lacing, fair amount of streaming carbonation, and clinging bubbles on the glass. Okay appearance. Aromas of white grape juice, roses, wine, cracker, corn, white bread, white sugar, and light herbal/grassy hops. Nice aromas with good balance of grapes/wine flavors, pale malt, sugar, and slight herbal hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big white grape juice, roses, wine, cracker, corn, white bread, white sugar, and light herbal/grassy hops. Mild herbal/grassy bitterness, and grape tang/tartness on the finish. Lingering notes of white grape juice, roses, wine, cracker, corn, white bread, white sugar, and light herbal/grassy hop notes of the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and balance of grapes/wine flavors, pale malt, sugar, and slight herbal hop flavors; with a solid malt/bitter/tartness balance, and no cloying flavors after the finish. Very crisp/clean finishing. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitter/tartness and carbonation. High carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, fairly grainy, and lightly syrupy/acidic/tangy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Minimal warming alcohol for 5.4%. Overall this is a very tasty flavored malt liquor. All around nice robustness and balance of grapes/wine flavors, pale malt, sugar, and slight herbal hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink. Very flavorful and not watery for the ABV. Not overly sweet from crisp carbonated dryness. Tastes like a wine cooler more than a malt liquor, but I rate on enjoyment for weird stuff like this. They did really well for whatever they were going for on the champagne-like flavor profile. A very enjoyable offering.",3.72

Champale Golden,"Finding this was the brightest bright spot in my recent hellish roadtrip to Savannah, GA. Been looking for it for years, ever since I was little and my uncle would regale me with tails of a mystical beverage, marketed to the very poor, that was part malt liquor and part champagne.  
 
I was expecting something awful--along the lines of the mythical Meister Brau, which I still haven't found--is surprisingly pretty okay. Not just a regular malternative–you can pick up definite nodes of champagne yeast, along with big nodes of artificial grape flavoring that taste not like dimetapp but like actual grape, only artificial.",3.1
Champale Golden,"I originally entered Champale Golden and Pink Champale on beeradvocate years ago and the bros turned it down, saying something like ""no way dude"" because I'd mentioned it was flavored with grape. I think I said something in my review that offended them along the lines of ""historically, it was the first malternative"", but the truth remains that it was, and still is - if you can find it (it's production is limited now).  
 
Champale Malt Liquor, starting with ""Dry Champale"" in 1939, was, in fact, advertised as a ""flavored malt beverage"" back in the '60's.  
 
More importantly, my review also gave a quick history of the brew, noting that it was brewed in Trenton, NJ, and that it helped save brewing in the area by allowing other ""dying"" brands to stay alive. Additionally, it was marketed directly to African Americans as a ""poor man's champagne"", which was somewhat unusual at the time, and still retains a high level of interest.  
 
So what's it like? Golden. Clear. Highly carbonated. Fruity and sweet with notes of grape. That's about it. I wouldn't call it balanced, but I really wouldn't call it ""cloying"" either. It's an interesting and unusual beer that also has a lot of history behind it. If you can find it, you should try it just to see what it's all about.",3

Extra Dry,"696ml (???) clear glass bottle nabbed at Bottle Mart, Port Douglas, Australia. 
 
Insipid, hitting on 6-row and a faint corn-like adjunct note but nothing else. Stupidly simple with a neutral flavour, but I'd stop short of calling it watery...it does have body. 
 
I guess this is a beer I'd pair with overly spicy Thai food or atomic hot buffalo wings, but only then because I wouldn't be ""wasting"" a beer with actual flavour.

Extra Dry,"Tooheys Extra Dry, or TEDs as they're colloquially known in Australia, is a well known mass produced adjunct lager, that had its heyday in the early to mid 2000s. Originally brewed at 5%, it's alcohol content has decreased significantly to 4.4%. Once a popular beer amongst teenagers and young adults looking for a quick easy buzz it was marketed as an easy drinking lager, and gained notoriety with music festivals and outdoor events. Nowadays, it's less popular, and Tooheys are attempting to revive it, by playing on it's declining popularity with a marketing campaign of being 'proudly ordinary'.  
 
Look: Standard Aussie mass produced adjunct lager look to it. Golden hue, medium size head, soap sudsy looking which disappated quickly to a white bubbling slick. It's an Aussie lager, it looks pretty standard.  
 
Smell: Classic Aussie adjunct lager smell. Grainy, faint fruity hop aroma. Bready yeast, a little chemically, almost like a citrus air freshener. A little bit of egg white.  
 
Taste: Sweet maltiness, slight fruitiness. Not overly bitter. light graininess . The dryness lingers in the palate, and tastes a bit chemically. Quite bland even for an Aussie adjunct lager.  
 
Feel: Light, refreshing when ice-cold, highly carbonated. Tastes like a beer that you're going to knock back several of without really caring about what you're drinking. You're drinking it for the buzz it will eventually give you if you knock back enough of them.  
 
Overall: I like many Australians drank a fair bit of this back in the day when we were young, dumb and thinking we were cool. I remember many a headache afterwards, and associated nasty hangovers with this stuff. I must say, it certainly isn't as good as it once was, and the fact that Tooheys are advertising it as 'proudly ordinary' is really all that needs to be said about TEDs. It's an ordinary beer. Nothing fancy, it's not trying to be stylish. It's there to serve a purpose, and not to be savoured. Although I don't know how much longer than can keep marketing this when they keep knocking down the ABV. It's going to be mid-strength the way it's going before too long, following in the footsteps of the Carlton Cold.",2.17

Mouthfeel: Decently carbonated and very thin. Watery the whole way through. It goes down very easy to say the least. 
 
Overall, it's not vomitrocious. It's not good either. I can't say I will be picking this one up again.",1.9

Pours super pale yellow, huge head that actually leaves a bit of lacing on the plastic hotel cup (I'm classy fuck you). 
 
Smell is um..not pleasant. something offputting about it. Not beery at all. 
 
Taste is, well I've had worse, tastes like a macro light, no worse than Bud light and a crap load cheaper. 
 
Mouthfeel is water, strike that, it's carbonated water. Kinda like H2OH, if you've ever had that. 
 
Drinkability. I've already 4 in, and have one more to finish, along with 2 more New Glarus, the fact that I can still type after 10 beers in the last hour says to me that it is pretty sessionable. Not that it tastes good, but at this point I'm really not getting the full flavor, and it hasn't made me puke yet, so bottoms up. 
 
In short, cheap beer, not objectionable if you are just looking to get hammered in the cheapest way possible and you have something against malt liquor. But if you want beer, then don't buy this.",1.66

M- The mouthfeel? Put water in your mouth and see for yourself. 
 
D- This beer is pretty sessionable for me. While I dont think the taste is great, the lack of a bad aftertaste is a plus for me, and I have no problem throwing 10-15 of these back in a night. I can't say the same about some other macro brews. 
 
If you are looking for the cheapest reasonable beer possible to get drunk, I'd recommend Minhas. It definitely isn't any worse than your typical Macro brews, but about a third of the price. If you are looking for good beer, avoid at all costs.",1.73

Into a large mug, it sizzles with lively carbonation, but not really enough to emulate champagne. Anemic pale gold color, with a finger of white foam that rapidly fades to a thin ring around the sides. 
 
Smells like 7-up and white grape juice, definitely artificially sweetened. Tastes and feels very similar to 7-up... fake lemon lime, sweet, bubbly, astringent. There's a undercurrent of swill in the aftertaste, along with a chalky smarties candy sweetness. I'm getting flashbacks to college, briefly experimenting with Tequiza, Mike's, and similar artificially fruity alcopops. Doesn't really come across as a Malt Liquor with all the sweetener and ""flavoring"" dumped in. Four Loko and the like have gotta be edging Champale off the market...",2.4

The Headless Gourdsman,"2023 Barrel-Aged Series Release - 4 pack 
12 oz. bottle dated 06.29.23 - 13.1% ABV / ? IBU 
Brewed and bottled in Grand Rapids, MI 
Poured into a Bell's branded tulip snifter glass 
 
Look - Pours a pretty thin, but fluffy off-white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. Opaque, light to dark red appearance. 
Smell - The scent is faint, and the spices are dominate. Nutmeg stands out the most, and cinnamon lingers in the background. 
Taste - The bourbon is stronger in the taste and the pumpkin spices compliment it well. You also get the vanilla and oak from the barrel and the alcohol is almost nonexistent. 
Feel - Light-medium bodied with a warm mouthfeel and finishes medium dry. 
Overall - This is a fantastic beer. The pumpkin spices blend very well with the barrel qualities, and it achieves that without a predominate booziness.",4.77
The Headless Gourdsman,"This one pours a medium dark amber color, with a small white head, and a little bit of lacing. 
 
 
 
This smells like scented candle wax dropped into Aunt Jemima’s syrup – it is not appealing. 
 
 
 
I honestly had pretty high hopes for this one, but they were not met in any way. This tastes like a syrupy scented candle – the maple syrup just kind of dulls any interesting character there might have been, and just blankets an uninteresting bland sweetness on it. It really just does taste like a melted candle – the pumpkin and spices just feels so artificial. It’s not a pleasant beer to work through a pour of. 
 
This is syrupy, with low carbonation, and just very little enticing drinkability. 
 
This was just a huge swing and a miss for me. Founders makes some great beers, but this is far from one of them.",2.95

The Headless Gourdsman,Pours a dark amber. Thin foam. Maple syrup aroma. Very sweet brown sugar body. Prominent maple flavor with a slight bitter finish. You can taste the alcohol but not too heavy. Not much of a pumpkin flavor. A great fall dessert beer.,4

The Headless Gourdsman,Pours a dark brown color with a minimal head that disappears quickly. Aroma of maple syrup and cinnamon. Taste is very sweet maple with a good alcohol warmth.,4
The Headless Gourdsman,"A - Deep cinnamon colored pour with dense, frothy light caramel colored lacing and moderate carbonation. 
 
S - Cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, soome maple, and Bourbon. 
 
T - Bourbon and spice dominate this beer, period. Bourbon, vanilla, all spice, cinnamon, and nutmeg are the main spices coming through along with a sweet malt base including Maple. Ends on the sweeter side with a lingering Bourbon and pumpkin spice on the palate. 
 
M - Thick, viscous, and velvety with some light prickly carbonation fighting through the thickness of the liquid. There is some warming in the back of the throat on the way down. 
 
O - It's a style you either love or hate, no one seems to be on the fence. I like pumpkin beers, therefore = recommended.",4.12
The Headless Gourdsman,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter  
Appearance – The brew pours a deep orange-amber color with a tiny head of off white foam. The head fades very fast leaving almost no lacing on the sides of the glass.  
Smell – The aroma burst with tons of roasted and toasted pumpkin paired with a good showing of spice and sweet. The sweet smells are of caramel, brown sugar and maple syrup, while the spice is of cinnamon, nutmeg and clove. There is also a huge presence of oak and a very boozy bourbon smell. Other aromas of char and smoke as well as some orange and cough medicine are there as well, creating a super boozy and rich spiced pumpkin smell overall. 
Taste – The taste starts out with a rather robust and thick syrupy roasted pumpkin taste with a decent showing of cinnamon, nutmeg and clove. There is also a whole lot of doughiness and a huge amount of maple syrup and brown sugar with the alcohol is definitely not hidden. Right from the start, one can taste a bourbon and cough syrup alcohol taste which grows stronger as the taste advances. Other flavors of oak and a touch of earth develop as the taste advances as well, and with the huge alcohol and big pumpkin pie like flavors one is left with a very boozy and thick pumpkin pie strong ale like taste to linger on the tongue. 
Mouthfeel – The body is super thick and syrupy while the carbonation level is rather low. The feel pairs with the flavors and booziness quite well, making for a very slow sipper indeed. 
Overall – A little too thick and boozy for me. I was expecting something more balanced from Founders and was really looking forward to a pumpkin brew, but this one was a little too rich for my taste.",3.82
The Headless Gourdsman,"A 12 oz. bottle pours a cherry-cola colored, see-through brew with a one finger off-white head that disappears quickly and zero lacing. This looks like no pumpkin ale I have ever seen before. The smell is also unique.. cinnamon, ginger, bourbon and other spice undercurrents. The taste is explosive! Bourbon, a very boozy bourbon... maple, cinnamon and nutmeg. The sweetness is on the verge of overpowering. This seems more on the cusp of a very good Christmas Ale, than a pumpkin beer. Reading the back of the label, Founders states that ""No actual pumpkins were harmed in the making of this beer"". I guess it is more a 'pumpkin spice' beer, than a pumpkin beer. Whatever it is, it is a bit cloying and sticky, but it tastes very good, more like a Manhattan than a pumpkin beer. The 13.1 ABV kicks ass, It's clear like a lab created pumpkin beer and lacks the pulp present in the very best pumpkin ales... nevertheless, it's a damn good beer, a damn good fall and winter beer, a great 'Nightmare Before Christmas' type beer. It's tasty, unique, and reccommended.",4.33
The Headless Gourdsman,"Poured a dark amber color with a beige head the tried but failed to cover the surface. 
The aroma is lost on my Covid damaged nose. 
The taste - the first couple sips were like gas station cappuccino, pumpkin spice flavor. It was really odd. After warming a bit that impression faded away and there was a relatively tasty barrel aged ale but I couldn't detect pumpkin any longer. It finished out this way. Curiously one dimensional. 
The feel was very good for the ABV, nicely viscous - this is a sipping beer, not a slamming beer. 
OA, glad I got a single as I'm not sure I could have finished the 4 pack. Not that I thought it didn't taste all right but more that it's just not my cup of tea. So to speak.",3.74

Michelob Ultra Infusions Lime & Prickly Pear Cactus,"Pours a clear barely golden yellow with a head that is like champagne and disappeared fast. Smell is lime,grains,some type of fruit(probably prickly pear) Taste is delivered clean and neat with a proportionate amount of the adjuncts which are discernible by the individual fruit. Again feels well put together,crisp,refreshing,well carbonated. This beer, being organic would not be possible without the huge buying power of InBev Overall for a light lager with adjuncts I will rate accordingly to the style.

Michelob Ultra Infusions Lime & Prickly Pear Cactus,"Purchased as a six-pack of bottles from Publix for $8.99. Poured into a pils glass. Posting this review from some notes I wrote down a couple of days ago, but only now could post to BA. 
 
L - Extremely pale yellow with no head and minimal lacing. 
S - Smells of corn flakes and faint lime. Almost sweet. 
T - Lime is pretty upfront, followed by an almost artificial prickly pear. Slight hint of dragonfruit and light hay. 
F - Lightly carbonated and very light body. A step above La Croix. Refreshing. 
O - I don't hate this beer, but I find it a bit boring - mostly due to the very light body, unable to retain a lot of flavor. If it wasn't a light beer, I feel like this would be a home run for the Michelob lineup. Glad to have finally tried it, though.",1.97
Michelob Ultra Infusions Lime & Prickly Pear Cactus,"Amazing beer, but in a very specific way. Very refreshing, though perhaps not the highest quality beer on the market.

Punkuccino,"12 oz bottle from the Elysian pumpkin mixed 12-pack. Poured into a snifter. Copper color with a creamy head - almost nitro-like (or cappuccino-like?). Aroma and flavor feature pumpkin spice, sweet cream, caramel malt, toffee, and bitter (almost burnt) coffee. Mouthfeel is excellent, very smooth, full, and creamy. Solid overall and if not for the burnt character this would be even better.",3.86

Punkuccino,"I know this is Elysian and it's a popular brewery that was purchased by Miller so I heard the name of the beer and the description and honestly thought this beer was a joke. Pumpkin coffee stout? Come on! This beer is going to be rank. No one can pull this off. Oh contraire.  
 
Smell is pumpkin but you get undertones of coffee. Like a perfect balance. How is that? Taste is is equally balanced. Nice pumpkinq flavoring without being overpowering or tasting fake. A beer like this has to be so hard to nail down and they did it. Standing ovation.",4.72

Oktoberfest,I really like this beer. I’m not even a beer drinker. I bought it for my mom as she is a Yuengling drinker. I was shockingly surprised at how much I liked it. Even mom loves it better than her standard Yuengling. Flavor is smooth not bitter. Really nice texture and body. Highly recommend****,5
Oktoberfest,"Tasted like their Traditional Lager with a drop of Samuel Adams Octoberfest added to each bottle, and a 6pk is about the same price as one of Yuengling's 12pks. Not the marzen you should settle for. 
 
Style: Marzen | Tap/Can/Bottle: Bottle | Abv: 5.4% | Rating: 3.5",3.5
Oktoberfest,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into pint glass. 
 
Dark amber in color, what you would expect from an Oktoberfest offering. Very little head, maybe 1/8 of an inch which dissipates quickly, no lacing. (look 3.75) 
 
Understated notes of bread, malt and caramel go well together, but do not stand out. (smell 3.5) 
 
Refreshing, but fairly light for a seasonal offering of this kind. A bit sweet and lacking in spice of other Oktoberfests. (taste 3.75) 
 
Very light in the beginning, but starts to stick around longer after about 1/4 of the way through. Highly drinkable, even if it is a bit on the lighter side (feel 4.00) 
 
Overall a pretty good Oktoberfest offering. Could easily have a few of these in one sitting., but It falls short of its closest highly available competitor, the more flavorful Sam Adams. (overall 3.5)",3.72
Oktoberfest,This is as close to a traditional German Oktoberfest beer as it gets without being in a German pub. The only way it could be any better is if was served on-tap. Or in a fest beer tent in Germany. I've had Yuengling Lager von fass at the brewery many years ago. I was impressed then but wasn't with their bottled lager as brewed by Miller. The Black & Tan was an improvement. But this Oktoberfest really hit the mark! This is the brew to serve at the Oktoberfest in Fredrickburg! Now I'm looking foward to trying their porter.,4.75
Oktoberfest,"It’s alright, prefer Sam Adams by a long shot. Good for gatherings for the price.",3.4
Oktoberfest,"12 oz bottle into a Becher glass. 
L: Pours true clear amber caramel with a light and fizzy off white head that has zero retention, steady carbo bubbles, no lacing. 
S: Caramel malts, faint apple, a hint of brown bread, light raisin notes. 
T: Taste follows aroma to the T adding background dark fruits, very little aftertaste and sensing lightly sweet & zesty citrus and malt. 
F: Brisk, light & dry. Interestingly dry. 
O: Very crushable and good tasting overall. I' enjoying it on a hot & steamy August day and it stays lively. If you like lighter bodied beers, this could be your friend. It is good in its style.",3.45
Oktoberfest,"I really like Yuengling traditional, so was excited to try this Marzen style. A little disappointed in the flavor. I love Oktoberfest beers, but this one is not a fav of mine. 
Not as malty and light on pronounced flavor.",2.64
Fest of Both Worlds,"Sampled this as a side-by-side with the JA Munich Fest. 
 
Pours a clear straw color with a half finger of head. The nose is fairly mild - some essence of biscuits and crackers. The flavor lacks the nutty character of Munich Fest but, by contrast, it is much more malty and full-bodied.",3.94

Beer poured golden with a nice white head that has some good hang time. 
 
Nose is fresh bread and notes of herbal and citrus. 
 
Taste has a lovely theme of honey bread and is perfectly balanced with hopping that gives a very light touch of pepper and lemon. Finishes with the toast and honey flavor. 
 
Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and smooth.

Mouth is med to a bit fuller bod, med to higher foamy carb, soft lager

Fest of Both Worlds,Pours a beautiful bright golden with white wispy head. I get a little white grape on the nose with maybe a bit of unsweetened corn cake. It's quite grain forward. A touch of soapy noble hops. It's light bodied compared to say a House Lager. Carbonation is super soft. Something about this isn't hitting for me and I want to like this more.,3.87
Fest of Both Worlds,"A - Pours a nice medium gold color with perfect clarity, moderate carbonation, and a thin creamy layer of bright white foam resting on top. 
 
S - Nice herbally, earthy citrus spice on the nose. The aroma is really quite nice overall. 
 
T - Nice subtle honey malt base with just the right amount of hops over top to balance the beer out perferctly. Bright citrus, earthyy spice, a little bit of pine and a trace of juicy floral really hits the spot.  
 
M - Big medium body with prickly carbonation that ends soft on the tongue. 
 
O - This beer is about as perfect as it gets, I could drink this year around. Really nice and well worth checking out if you like O-fest beers.",4.25
Fest of Both Worlds,"16oz can into a tall glass. Canned 8/9/23, so a little over 2 weeks old. 
 
Looks splendid. Crystal clear golden body. Small white head persists leaving scattered lacing. Strong malty aroma, which continues in the taste with a light hop note. Smooth and clean, nice finish. Could drink this all day long.",4.06
Fest of Both Worlds,"It pours a bright and crystal clear light honey gold. Enormous head of white fluffiness forms with little encouragement, although I tend to pour aggressively. It falls to chunks and a ring, decent cling. Outstanding. 
 
The smell is deliciously malty - not heavy, a bit of a blend of crackery and bread dough. The hops are pretty subtle - light citrus and some faint herbal spice, some floral over the top. Very laid back. 
 
The taste is deceptive to me. It starts off a bit of ho hum, but it opens up into a blend of clean malts, mild bitterness, and then those new world hops blossom. Lemony brightness, floral and herbal earthiness, then a mildly surprising kick of spice in the aftertaste. So some aspects of Noble hops playing with more new world character. The bitterness seems appropriate - not quite a complete reset of the taste buds but enough while the aromatic hops continue to play. The lemon eventually seems a bit candy-like. I'm thinking the malt tends more to the bready side and there is an ever so slight sweetness. 
 
The feel is slick and silky smooth. Medium bodied, kind of middle of the road carbonation. It has that slightly richer than expected feel I've gotten in other beers using decoction mashing. 
 
This is plain old good stuff, in my opinion. I think both teams brought their ""A"" game, and the result is a beer that starts of with subtlety and finishes in a wholly different place. Looking at the style description, this beer could be the poster child. Ridiculously drinkable.",4.37

Country Club Malt Liquor,"If this bottle has a genie, he's a greasy extrovert of a genie, probably wearing lots of bling and parachute pants. 
 
Long ago, I helped a stranger who was struggling to unload some heavy items from her car. Afterward, she thanked me by handing me a can of Country Club, chilled in a cooler in her trunk. This is how an '80s gas station tastes. I haven't seen it again, but I recall it vividly, even now: wet dog, corn, and alcohol, with a modest armada of grit afloat. Astounding. It did have a nice sort of metallic can note, to be fair.  
 
If I see it again, I'm gonna try it, just to remind myself of the benchmark. Nothing -- not Coors, not Keystone, nothing -- could be as quintessentially awful. The label is a perfect predictor of everything inside. If they stop making Country Club, there will still be plenty left unsold in the gas stations of 2237.",1.24

Country Club Malt Liquor,"I remember this one from ""back in the day,"" and found it, a rare find around here, at a backwoods convenience store. I just had to try it again. Malt liquors were first marketed to white men back in the 1960's, believe it or not, and my Grandpa Bennett would always crack open an 8-oz. Country Club or two after work. My mom reportedly gave him holy hell when he was caught giving me a few sips as an 18-month old. I guess that he was just checking to see if the Irish parts of my body, i.e., those that are involved in processing alcohol intake, were working properly. And thus my ghetto taste in beers, apparently. Anyway, I was not too impressed, overall. It was flat and corny-tasting, with a weird, psuedo-metallic aftertaste. As I bought cans, I can't blame any skunking for the less than par experience. Still, I will give it the benefit of the doubt, the six I bought could have been sitting in the cooler for years. Wouldn't try it again, though.",2.49

Country Club Malt Liquor,"40oz clear glass bottle with a branded screw-top. No ABV listed on the label. ""America's premium malt liquor."" 
 
Pours a clear pale copper body with a good 3 fingers worth of off-white foam sitting atop. 
 
Aroma yields pale malt and cheap corn, lending this some sweetness but seemingly not too much. 
 
Taste is of pale malt and a bit of cheap corn adjunct, which isn't bad when coupled with the smooth, wet, light to medium-bodied mouthfeel. I always fear budget malt liquors will be syrupy and sticky, but this avoids that. 
 
Drinkable albeit forgettable inoffensive fare. I doubt I'll ever try it again unless I'm after a cheap buzz. More insipid than anything else. 
 
D (2.18) / NOT RECOMMENDED 
 
*** 
""Lucked"" into another clear 40oz bottle of this. Pricetag reads $3.00 (USD). The white and gold label design looks like something out of the Reagan era. 
 
Pours three fingers/7-8ish cm worth of off-white foam. Frothy and billowing. I can't knock it, and the retention is pretty nice at 6+ minutes. Body is a clear thin watery dark urine colour. No visible yeast or sediment; it's obviously filtered. 
 
Aroma brings notes of creamed corn and inoffensive pilsner malt along with a cheap grassy hop character. Diacetyl and DMS are indicated, and it seems too sweet. More of a grainy aroma would be nice. Average aromatic intensity. 
 
Taste is creamed corn, DMS off-flavour, and pilsner malts with some cheap syrupy sweetness dragging it down. Too sweet, though not egregiously so, and I've had more syrupy more thick malt liquors. Obviously, it's unrefreshing, but its creamy softness on the palate warrants commendation. Smooth and wet, and not as overcarbonated as many budget malt liquors. 
 
Overall, it's an inoffensive brew that drinks best at colder temperatures and will satisfy casual drinkers after a cheap buzz. I liked it better this time around than when I initially had it; I imagine these clear bottles sitting around in seedy Brooklyn bodegas are at high risk for being lightstruck. Not a terrible beer, but I can't recommend it even at this budget tier (see Ballantine XXX for a more worthwhile choice for budget drinkers).

Woof, this gives the big fusel alcohol feels. Not even that strong, but it amps it up on your breath. Its some high bitterness low hops, high alcohol, corn malt bill type of malt liquor, but without the punch, even though its mouthfeel kinda makes you think maybe otherwise.",2.53
Country Club Malt Liquor,"I am a gross fat monster and so I've been looking for Country Club for years.  
 
I read somewhere once that it was the first high-ish ABV beer that was directly marketed a malt liquor, and I've come across more than a few old print ads showing fifties-era frat boys pouring this stuff out of what look like pudding cans while coeds stumble in the background. It would be another decade plus until ads came along that were brazen enough to directly implicate malt liquor with date rape (thanks, Billy Dee Williams!), but we still got Country Club to thank for that trend. Needless to say, this beer has long been on my must-try list.  
 
Forties were just sitting at the bottom of the cooler in some gas station in the middle of upstate New York. I jokingly told the clerk that I thought they stopped making it in the 70s. He said they might have, considering how poorly they sold at this particular location, so that didn't bode too well for its freshness. 
 
Untwisting the cap, however, I pick up only a faint whiff of skunk, which is actually kinda complimentary in a weird way (some green bottle Euro saisons milk this effect quite well). The skunk is almost exclusively aromatic, however, as the flavor is neigh indistinguishable from MIckey's. Trust me, I've drank a lot of MIckey's, and this is just a skunked Mickey's. 
 
Which isn't bad, in my book, even if it's not exactly good. I wouldn't drink Mickey's so goddamn often if I truly disliked its flavor. It's not for beer geeks, yeah. But as a malt liquor served in 40s, it gets the job done and is absolutely inoffensive.",3.06

Blonde Ale,"Crystal clear, light gold color. Decent starting head but it fades to rim bubbles and leaves absolutely no lace. After five minutes, even the rim bubbles are gone. There is, however, a steady stream of upward bubbles throughout the tasting. 
 
Thin and weak aroma. Dry, almost a apple cider-like nose.  
 
Initially, I pick up on more apples. Lightly sour, lightly sweet. No notable hop. The body is very thin--like a macro. The carbonation is high but not like soda pop. The finish is flat and sour. Short aftertaste. Overall, it's not as bad as the rating I saw before the tasting, but it's not that good either.",2.41
Blonde Ale,"Clear light gold color with small white cap. 
 
Sweetish grain aroma with a slightly floral character. 
 
Very rounded flavor of clean grain with a touch of sweetness. Similar to AALs without rough edges. Simple grain taste with a minimum hop influence that finishes quick and clean. 
 
Medium texture with balancing carbonation. 
 
 
I don't understand the low reviews on this one unless there are some production problems. My example was clean and straight forward with a pleasant if unassuming character.",3.43

Blonde Ale,"L: very effervescent as streams of bubbles race to the surface. It is bright gold with a thin but persistent ivory foam collar 
 
S: aromas feature sorghum earthiness and orange peel with some hop citrus 
 
T: It starts prickley with orange and sorghum and some earthiness. The orange peel masks some of the sharp sorghum flavors and softens it 
 
F: medium light body and high carbonation 
 
O: The beer is a little cidery and the sorghum earthiness comes across as a little musty especially in the aftertaste.",3.5
Blonde Ale,"WTF? A bottled beer from woodychandler? This is a rarity. Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head and lots of carbonation. Smell is of sorghum, green apples. Taste is strong of sorghum, cough medicine, green apples, yucky yuck! Feels light in the mouth and overall thank God I am not gluten free.",2.4
Blonde Ale,It would be interesting for those guys that drink a lot of Modelo. It a session beer for the summer.,2.7
Blonde Ale,"12oz bottle - ok, back to the sorghum and brown rice extract method of removing gluten from the beer equation - gulp. 
 
This beer pours a clear, medium golden amber colour, with two fingers of puffy, loosely foamy, and mostly fizzy off-white head, which leaves a few minor instances of sea plume 'lace' around the glass as it quickly sinks out of sight. 
 
It smells like apple or white wine vinegar mixed with rubbing alcohol, with a heady dose of free-range berry sugar tossed right in, and an acrid vegetal graininess (my old nemesis, sorghum, right back out of Cletus' back 40 again, it would seem). The taste is sweet, musty, and kind of thin apple cider, more unpleasantly vegetal maltiness, some stricken earthy yeast, cheap dark sugar notes, and a hollow attempt at weedy and floral hop bitterness. 
 
The carbonation is fairly light in its incessant and pandering fizziness, the body on the wan side of the barest middleweight, and not really all that smooth, as the tart and pithy fruity nature doesn't lean that way. It finishes off-dry, that stale apple cider thing still a real going concern, while the other goings on are of no concern. 
 
Yup, the divide between the two processes for arriving at gluten-free (or reduced, I get it) beer ever widens. I can't really tell apart all the alternative grain offerings, especially from this brewery, as they are all pretty much a variation on what I've detailed here. Oh, and I just noticed that New Planet is from freaking Boulder, Colorado! How have they not yet been run out of town, or at the very least, um, better educated?",2.27

Oktoberfest,"Picked up a 6 pack of bottles out of the beer cave at OnCue on Broadway in Edmond, OK (OnCue is a clone of the beloved Tulsa-based C-store called QuikTrip).  
It was not stocked. Had to open a case to get to it. Fortunately it was already entered into the POS system and they could ring it up.  
 
Appearance: 
Clear Copper-amber with frothy buff head that lasts. 
 
Aroma: 
""Marzen""... without the umlaut. Smells more ""American"". Toasty, bready malts with hints of caramel and nuts, light floral/grassy hops. 
 
Flavor: 
Clean and crisp, not overly sweet and with a decent noble hop balance. Still does not have the nuance of a German version. 
 
Mouthfeel: 
Light to medium. Feels a lot like other Yuenglings.  
 
Overall: 
A respectable American O-Fest. Not complicated and has familiar and welcome characteristics. 
 
P.S.; I contrasted this with their flagship Traditional Lager and this tastes more nuanced and cleaner. I'd rather the traditional lager tasted like this , but unfortunately an all-malt Märzen costs more to make.",3.69

The beer pours a clear copper color with a fluffy beige/khaki head that dissipated quickly, leaving behind very little acing 
 
The aroma is typical of the American versions of this style; mostly sweet, with some bready malts and crackers. There is also a generic hoppyness. 
 
The flavor has a caramel sweetness with notes of crackers and dark bread, There is also a hint of spicy hops. Light bodied and moderately carbonated. 
 
Overall, This is a dumbed down version of the style, quite drinkable but not terribly interesting",3.38
Oktoberfest,"Looks like a typical Oktoberfest beer, smell was of biscuits and flowers, just lovely. Taste was smooth and creamy just the right amount of sweetness. Mouthfeel was a little sticky.

Country Club Malt Liquor,"I had been seeking this out for a long time. I found it at a liquor store in Waltham, MA one summer day in 2012. It was found in the customary 40 ounce bottle, just sitting there with a gaggle of other 40's; as if to scream out ""take me home."" I bought it and took it to where I was staying. I cracked open the bottle to find wafts of skunk, but these skunky scents did not deter me from enjoying this malt. The taste was something else, like a classic malt liquor should taste: sweet malts and a hint of adjunct. 
 
I was able to consume the 'Club. Overall I'd have this again. Since that day however, I have been unable to find it; s though the beer gods seem to have said ""only once.""",3.23

Geez, Louise, no sooner had I begun to Pop! the cap than I got a bunch of foam coming up through the neck! I placed the bottle in the awaiting glass and waited for it to calm down before proceeding. Can you say, ""Gentle pour"", boys and girls? It acted like soda pop, creating three-plus fingers of fizzy, foamy, bone-white head that burbled, popped and fizzled its way out of existence. Color was Straw-Yellow (SRM = > 2, < 4) with NE-plus quality clarity. Nose had an apple vinegar-like sharpness and I have noted this before in other G-F beers. Mouthfeel was thin, kind of watery. The taste had a tart apple-like flavor, which, while not great, was drinkable. Finish was semi-dry with an apple-like flavor that seemed to linger.

Appearance -The beer pours a clear golden color with a one finger head of white foam. The head has a good level of retention, fading slowly and leaving a ton of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. 
Smell – The aroma is strong of a cracker malt and pine smell mixed with aromas of grapefruit and some earthiness. Along with these smells comes a touch of orange and pear. 
Taste – The taste starts out with a nice crisp cracker malt mixed with notes of grapefruit and a decent showing of pine. At the start the hop is lighter, with both the grapefruit and pine getting stronger and being joined by some light earthy and herbal hops. Toward the end the light sweetness of caramel that was present upfront fades, leaving one with a rather nice crisp and decently hopped taste to linger on the tongue. 
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is light and crisp with a higher carbonation level. Great for the abv and style and makes for a nice crisp sipper. 
Overall – A very nice and crisp sipper. Well done and great for session drinking.",4.1

Pumking - Caramel,"Clear, nearly transparent dark amber body. Good head production and retention. 
 
Aroma is a bit musty, implying a heavy hand of the dry spices. Caramel isn't particularly noticeable, but it may be hiding along with the malt base. Otherwise, this smells like a fairly classic pumpkin ale - which Pumpking is. It smells quite good, but it also portends too much dry spice, which can easily overwhelm a beer. 
 
The hefty 8.6% base helps fend off that dry spice on the palate, but it's still more of a player than I'd prefer. There's a hint of the artificiality of regular Pumking that I detest, but it's honestly not quite as bad - but also not as solid as Warlock. At the same time, the caramel doesn't quite add enough; it's there when you know to look for it, but otherwise could easily be overlooked. The pie crust is a lovely addition, honestly, as it adds a slightly sweet and grainy flavor to the malt base in complementary fashion. 
 
Overall, this isn't bad, and it fits the season. It's an improvement over regular Pumking, but it's not going to be a pumpkin ale I happily reach for, either - on the rare occasion I'm in such a mood at all.",3.62
Pumking - Caramel,,4.12
Pumking - Caramel,"OK, just for clarity, this isn't Caramel Pumpkin, although CARAMEL appears in bold capital letters above Pumpkin Imperial Pumpkin Ale on the label. The label even suggests 'rule on caramel'. None of the semantics matters, after two twelve ounce brown bottles are emptied into a clear glass liter mug. There's very little head. The brew is a bright and relatively clear copper-amber. The aroma brings modest Pumpkin pie spices, with an additional sweetness. This is a wonderful extension of the Imperial Pumpkin mainstay from this brewery. Pumpkin and Warlock are Pumpkin brews without reproach. Add this one to that list. The caramel inclusion is very tastefully done. It doesn't overly sweeter the brew, it only adds a minor taste that makes a major enjoyment. Adding just a little caramel sweetness and body does nothing to shortchange the original Pumpkin Ale. Everything true to the original remains in tact here, like taste, body and mouthfeel. That's a good thing, because this brewery has few rivals when it comes to Imperial Pumpkin Ales. This is a pleasant, although not drastic, variation on a very successful brew.",4.4

Pours a golden copper with a solid finger of head which thins to a ring with a modicum of lacing. Smells pretty strongly, not necessarily of caramel, but like toffee hard candies. I get a bit of baking spice as well. But yeah, mostly just overwhelming candy sweetness. A dessert beer, for sure. Taste brings a good deal of vanilla to the party. I suppose it's there on the nose, too, just buried a bit. Butterscotch liquor. Not as sweet as feared; finishes on the dry side, in fact. Good pie crust-style malt base (the beer's strong point, IMO). A little boozy. Medium-to-full bodied. Kind of a weird one, but that might be owing to the fact that I'm drinking it in late Summer. It's definitely not a Summer beer, even if it is on the cooler side today. I think I'm going to sit on a couple of these. This feels like it would be a good post-Thanksgiving dinner beer.

Feel...A slick and DrinkEasy properties make it with a little lacing and a vibrant carbonation that lightens the filling.

Big Hazy,"True to Lawson's, this is a hazy DIPA that is nowhere near a turbid murk bomb. Instead, it's slightly cloudy, but you can nearly read through it regardless. Solid head production and retention. 
 
On the nose, it's difficult to tell where the hop expression ends and the orange begins - in a good way. Very complementary notes. 
 
More bitter than most in the ""hazy"" crowd, but dialed back perhaps a touch from the Sunshine series. It also lacks some of the soft malt sweetness of the Sunshine beers; Ruby Red Grapefruit Double Sunshine is a natural comparison point, but this beer, while very good in its own right, isn't nearly as nuanced and delicious. There's a nice slightly sour sharpness from the natural orange, and lighter tropical and stone fruit notes adding to the citrus-forward mix. 
 
Supremely drinkable, especially given the ABV, but it does drink much closer to a WC or ""traditional"" IPA than it does a hazy IPA. 
 
Overall, this is frankly a delicious beer, and very refreshing despite the monster ABV. It's nowhere near Lawson's finest, however (pun not intended), nor is it the best example of the style. Lawson's has only fairly recently started chasing the NE IPA trend, ironic considering they, along with HF and the Alchemist, were the proto-NE IPAs upon which the style emerged. Sadly, they don't chase trends nearly as well as they set them - but falling well shy of Lawson's lofty heights results in a beer that's still really damn good.",4.15

Oktoberfest Märzen,"First day of Oktoberfest! 
 
11.2 oz bottle acclimated to 41°F and poured into a dimpled stein. 
 
Pours a clear, vibrant, and darker rust color, very nice color. Produces a 1.5 finger frothy, barely cream colored head, lasting a while and leaving a ring and spots of lacing. Beautiful beer. 
 
Initial aroma is caramel and butter solids that have been separated from the oil, it's also slightly reminiscent of dough. I seem to get some hops in the floral, peppery range as well. After agitating I notice a mild feta like smell, really does smell salty. 
 
Initial taste before swallowing is mildly bitter and sweet, having trouble noticing anything else. After swallowing it's yeasty, with ample caramel malt and pleasant bitterness. I notice some hops in the back of the mouth, tasting floral like white and green. I also get that butter solids smell in the taste which I highly enjoy, and a note of bready dryness. In there I get a big hit of caramel, tasting honestly like real caramel, not just caramel malts, there's sweetness to it too. I get butter notes too, so it's approaching butterscotch, genuinely excellent. Heavy note of damp grass with a little hay(?) in the aftertaste, as well as almost a cheesiness, definitely umami, whatever it is. 
 
Mouthfeel is not incredible but still very nice. I would say it's very easy to drink, and it feels great while drinking it. Not the smoothest I've had but absolutely full feeling. The carbonation can be reconstituted through agitation, although I don't find it adds a huge amount. 
 
Overall I'm very impressed. It's been a while since I've tried a märzen and I need to try more now. This excels in every category. I'd say my favorite overall part of the experience was the butter solids in the taste and smell, and the big hit of caramel, which tasted like real caramel and really wowed me. This could be a rare example of beer I'd drink while eating, although I'd stick to uncomplicated foods. I could easily drink several happily, especially in the late September weather as intended. I love it! 
 
I will definitely buy again, 6 packs. I'll happily recommend it as well.",4.39

Pours clear copper with an in of white head. Moderate retention and lacing. Toasted bread crusts in the nose with proofing dough. Medium bodied with a soft mouthfeel. A bit tacky. Sweet, plump malt on the palate with a balancing bitterness. Finishes malty and fairly sturdy without excessive sweetness.",4
Oktoberfest Märzen,,4.61
Oktoberfest Märzen,"Good Marzen, happy to find on tap. Up front I was getting tons of malts and bitter hops. About half way through I was picking up a lot of banana esters and alcohol sweetness, a bit of caramel on the finish. Kind of played with my mind. I’ll have to revisit this again to sort out my thoughts.",4
Oktoberfest Märzen,"This is the Oktoberfest you want if you like malty beers. My guess is that this is the maltiest Oktoberfest you will find anywhere at any price today, and it's certainly the maltiest I have had in many, many years. It pours a vibrant copper color and sports a good head that lasts.  
 
Side Rant: This is precisely the Oktoberfest I wish more small breweries would brew. It is unapologetically roasty and malty, and I don't know if it is too expensive and/or too hard to brew for less experienced brewers, but if you own or work at a small brewery, taste/analyze this year's Hacker-Pschorr's Oktoberfest, and then try to make it. There's a difference you can taste in this beer. This tastes like ""old-school"" Oktoberfest (let the price of malt in 2023 be damned!). I honestly don't think there's any margin on this brew, so I'm just going to conclude that this is Hacker-Pschorr's gift to us this fall. So just enjoy it. Prost!",4.6

Slapasaurus,"First impressions aren't good. There's way too much stark white foam, just from cracking open a pint can with resultant overflowing. The attempted pour to try to empty the can's contents into a clear glass liter mug is also frustrated by all the foam. That's surprising, as high ABV brews usually aren't this foamy. Obviously, there's more than barley malt here providing the starch backbone. The foam recedes unevenly, unattractively and leaves erratic lacing inside the vessel. Once it can be determined, the liquid is light copper-amber, bright and somewhat translucent. The aroma is limited to a dry hoppiness, with some vague starch. It doesn't taste badly. Of course there's alcohol present and it's immediate. The hop taste is vague, maybe piney, but certainly bittering. The biggest surprise and the biggest plus is the mouthfeel. Despite an alcoholic burn to the taste buds, this is remarkably soft and smooth across the tongue. Overall, it actually has a tasty malted backbone, along with a nice dry hop bite to finish. The pronounced taste of alcohol is mitigated by its smooth mouthfeel and that it has an ABV close to 10%. This is another example of alcohol adding to the sweetness upfront, then drying out the bitterness at the finish. A final surprise is the stratified glass lacing, once the foam subsided There are many worse options to down a pint for a serious beer buzz.",4.07

Slapasaurus,"The seldom studied and often forgotten imperial American IPA may be a beer destined for the history books, but 3 Floyds is single handedly keeping the style alive with this dinosaur of a beer. 
 
Slapasaurus hits the glass with a medium amber appearance rounded with a reasonably hop induced haze. As its creamy off-white froth builds so to a host of tropical fruit aromas with citrus, spruce and grassy herbs in the backdrop. But a malty-sweet upstart gives the palate a calmer taste of honey, caramel, graham cracker and granola with the beer's opening taste. 
 
As the malts stew persistently on the middle palate a quick followup of hops give a bold tropical impression of pineapple, mango and papaya. Not to be outdone, more citrusy tones of red grapefruit, tangerine and lime aid the beer's racy and fruity zest. Trending rapidly bitter, the taste develops a strong and deeply resinous bite with flavors of fruit peels, pine needle, fresh-cut grass and hemp in its wake. 
 
Medium bodied and sticky with both malt and hop resins, the session finishes decidedly on the bitter side of bitter-sweet with drier take on malty-dry as the spicy ale comes to a close. A long follow through of pine sap, citrus remnants and curaçao liquor-type spice comes in perpetual waves.",4.46

Appearance – The beer pours dark amber brown color with a one finger head of puffy tan foam. The head has a fantastic level of retention, very slowly fading over time and leaving tons of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. 
Smell – The aroma of the brew is strong of a roasted and toasted bready smell mixed with lots of caramel, toffee, and molasses. Along with these smells comes notes of maple syrup and a touch of char and spice. 
Taste – The taste begins with a sweet brown sugar and maple syrup flavor mixed with some lightly toasted bready flavors. AT the same time there are notes of molasses and toffee as were depicted in the nose. As the taste advances some lightly bitter coffee and a hint of char come to the tongue, along with a touch of smoke. The sweetness initially dwindles from the start, only to surge at the end, leaving one with a rich and sweet roasty taste to linger on the tongue. 
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is thick for a 5.2 % abv brew with a carbonation level that is on the moderate side. For the maple and brown sugar tastes the feel is nice, creating a coating feeling to accentuate the rich tastes.

Appearance: The body is a fairly dark shade of copper with brilliant clarity. It has a medium-sized fluffy white head that has excellent head retention. There are some lines of lacing that stick to the glass. The color and clarity of the beer are very nice. 
 
Aroma: There is a nice pine aroma with a light wildflower scent that accompanies it. It has a bit of a floral soap quality to it. The aroma as a whole is pretty subtle but very nice. 
 
Taste: Up front there is a very floral flavor which comes across as soap like, similar to the aroma of the beer. A light bit of pine flavor comes through towards the middle of the palate and it is joined with a very light touch of flowers. There is a very light biscuit flavor towards the end. It has a slight grassy note towards the end, and it has a pleasant lingering pine flavor in the aftertaste. The flavors in this beer are very pronounced and they stay strong at every point while drinking this beer, as the beer crosses from the front to the back of the tongue. 
 
Mouthfeel: It feels clean and easy to drink. It has a pleasant hoppy bitterness which feels just right with the rest of the beer. It's a very enjoyable beer. 
 
Overall: Boston Beer Company / Samuel Adams really hit it out of the park with this beer. The neckerchief states that this is a ""DRY HOPPED GOLDEN LAGER."" There have been a lot of hoppy lagers and India Pale Lagers emerging over these last couple of years. This beer is a lot better than the vast majority of what I have tried. It is a beer with a very clean lager profile that still manages to deliver a great hop presence. The aroma is a bit muted but the hop notes which do show up are very good. I bought this in the fall variety pack but it's good enough to buy a six-pack. I would buy it again and I would highly recommend it.",3.96

Resin,"12oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for $2.50. PKG 22333, which means that this was packaged on 11/30/22. That would make this beer 2 1/2 months old. 
 
Look: It's a beautiful copper color with a slight haze/particulate floaties in suspension appearance. Nice beige-colored head that is sticking around. 
 
Smell: Mild citrus notes with tons of spicy hop resin and pine. This is probably a bit too cold straight out of my beer fridge, so the full bouquet is not coming out. Some herbal/oniony notes on the finish. Subtle watermelon and papaya notes and some honey thrown in. 
 
Taste: This is aggressively hopped, but you wouldn't really know it from the nose. Up front, there is some caramel malt sweetness with subtle honey notes. Then the hops take over and this is an intensely bitter ride to the finish line and beyond. The bitter finish lingers long and is full of hop resins and earthy, woody pine along with lots of grapefruit peel and pith. All this being said, this Imperial IPA maintains a semblance of balance because there is a significant malt backbone to support the aggressive hop bill. As the hop bitterness on the finish eventually recedes, some cool, peppery watermelon notes are coming through giving this beer an oddly refreshing feeling. 
 
Feel: The body is medium plus with a slick, oily mouthfeel. 
 
Overall: This is a really solid West-Coast Style Double IPA. Personally, Imperial IPAs are not my favorite of styles but I can dig ones in this vein occasionally. For 9.1% ABV, it's quite drinkable. I would like to try to re-review this beer if I can get my hands on a fresher version.",3.71

Not a perfectly clear beer but looks still in the glass as far as carbonation. Smell is brown bread, grain, slight citrus from the hops. Taste is pretty well balanced.

OAKED Arrogant Bastard Ale,"Reviewed from notes. 
 
Pours a reddish brown from the 22 ounce bottle, excellent clarity. Off white, foamy head that was generous and lasted for a time before reducing to a nice, foamy cap. 
 
The smell is not as aggressive as anticipated. I get a sweet impression - caramel/toffee and sweet dark fruits - raisin/fig maybe date. There's enough resinous pine to give a promise of a hefty bitterness, but there are also softer floral notes, an earthiness, a very slight citrus zest. The malts weigh in with biscuits and toast. Spicy like cloves. 
 
The taste delivers on what's promised by the smell. Caramel and toffee lead followed by sweet dark fruit. This rides on the back of the toast and biscuit flavors. Then other flavors come along - a woodiness from the oak, floral, earthy, definite citrus zest resembling orange, and big but not unpleasant sharp bitterness. No sign of the ABV whatsoever. While it could be jagged, everything comes together for a smooth experience. 
 
Everything lingers into the aftertaste. It's got a nice, sticky feel without being overly cloying. Carbonation seems medium and appropriate for this beer. Smooth and creamy. Oddly the beer ""feels good"". 
 
Overall, this was a smooth-drinking flavor bomb. Layered and integrated very nicely even with the substantial kick of bitterness. Well done.",4.18

It’s been a while since I’ve had anything new from Founders, but I couldn’t resist a new KBS variant. Blueberry seems like an odd choice for it, though I do tend to enjoy fruited Stouts when they’re properly executed. Let’s pop it open and see what it has to offer 
 
Pours completely pitch black with 2 fingers of creamy tan head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves decent lacing 
 
The blueberry in the nose is quite gentle, almost like they just used a fruity coffee. I’m picking up on aromas of dark roast coffee, jammy blueberry, milk chocolate, maple syrup, toasted oak, vanilla, light cinnamon, and a touch of bourbon 
 
There’s much more blueberry in taste, and it brings a nice tartness to it. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting tart blueberry, medium roast coffee, dark chocolate, toasted oak, burnt caramel, vanilla, earthy bourbon, black cherry, and light molasses. The swallow brings notes of medium roast coffee, tart blueberry, red grape, maple syrup, dark chocolate, charred oak, earthy bourbon, molasses, light raisin, and vanilla 
 
A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer. Finishes mostly dry with a fruity tartness that dries things out even further 
 
This isn’t my favorite variant, but it’s still very enjoyable. Prehaps I’ll pick up a few more bottles",4.22

OA, it’s always on draft around W Michigan which is good as they seldom bottle or can it as it looses flavor quickly. Or so they say. I’d rather drink an older container of this than not drink it at all. 
Really good beer!",4.57

Prima Pils,"I like a pilsner with a little funk, that taste of the cellar or cave and Prima has a little funk. It also has a slight skunkyness which I am less enamored with. But the slight skunkyness is dissolved by the hoppy bite at the end. All in all one of the best pilsners I've had. and one of my favorite brews.",4.38
Prima Pils,"This is generally considered an American classic take on German pilsner, and there's a darn good reason for it. 
 
There's a wonderful hoppy bite, but it carries the almost spicy neutrality of Noble hops, not the over the top citrus or tropical fruit of New World varietals. It's hoppy and bitter, but it's by no means an IPL. Drinks crisp and clean, with a bready, grainy deliver of the malt bill. Fairly dry finish. 
 
It's also less complex than the best pilsners, but at the same time, it's not exactly a low volume boutique offering. Getting this kind of quality from a readily available six pack is, frankly, pretty impressive.",4.16
Prima Pils,"The second time I’ve had this so time to review. Pours a golden orange with good head. Smells a little funky, skunky, and sweet. Tastes like citrus, a little spicy, grassy, a little skunky but it’s a good skunk, and a nice bitterness from the german hops. A good pilsner and a refreshing beer, cheers!",4.02

Prima Pils,"From a tap, it was delivered inside a clear pint glass. There's some pleasant white head, with bright amber colored and nearly translucent liquid beneath. Typical Pilsner hops and malting hit the nose. Like many of its style brewed in Pennsylvania, this is an outstanding one. With a body that's supple, yet both smooth and light, it carries the taste near perfectly. There's just enough bitterness to the hops, as it should be. The finish carries that, as it becomes dry. Not much to witness when looking for glass lacing, but that's not why people drink beer. It may not be the best Pilsner brewed in this Commonwealth, but it's better than most made in America.",4.22
Prima Pils,"Best by 7/2023 
 
Appearance: Pours a completely clear, medium golden color with a moderate white head that laces. SRM of 7. (4.00) 
 
Aroma: Strong aromas of floral and lemon citrus hops, some yeast with a slight Belgian spices of lemon and juicyfruit. (4.00) 
 
Flavor: Strong flavors of floral and grassy hops. Bitter off the front followed by some Belgian yeast and some lemon citrus. Pale malts then with a smooth finish bitter finish. (4.00) 
 
Feel: Medium bodied, strong carnation, grainy bitter and clean. (4.25) 
 
Compared to Fair State Pils 5/2023: Pours darker, milder head. Stronger aromas. More yeast and Belgian spices of lemon and juicyfruit. Less bitter flower. Dryer and cleaner. 
 
Overall: A very nice drinking German Pilsner here. Strong floral and bitter hops also with a strong yeast presence that gives hints of juicyfruit. Dry, bitter, yeasty, and clean. Seems like it blends a German Pils, kellerbier, with a touch of goodness from Golden Monkey. It's complex and drinks well. (Rating: 4.08)",4.08

Aroma is rich and full bodied, lots of strong roasty character, almost a hint of charcoal, some coffee.

Péché Mortel,"11.5oz bottle purchased at Community Pint, in Spokane, WA. According to the stamp on the rear level, this was bottled on February 23, 2022. Different label than what is shown here. 
 
Poured into a snifter, this was the color of darkest night, with a thin tan head that did not stick around for very long. 
 
Nose was initially of coffee and molasses. As it warmed, there was an aroma similar to cinnamon that stepped up to the plate. 
 
Very understated. Vaguely coffeeish and cinnamon flavor, but the coffee was really quite muted. Apart from that, just a vaguely roasty malt flavor was present. Bitter coffee flavor at the swallow. 
 
Fairly light bodied for an imperial stout. Kinda watery, really. 
 
I'm not a fan. Maybe this is too old, maybe it was abused by whatever distributor brought it to Community Pint (I'm familiar enough with them to know they store beer well), but I also recall the two other beers I've had from Dieu du Ciel also turned out similarly when I got a chance to try them. Maybe I'm just not on their wavelength, or they're not on mine. I think I'm done trying their beers, short of actually going to Montreal and trying them at the source. Disappointing.",3.49
Péché Mortel,"Finally got to try this top ranked beer in Canada. Does it live up to it’s rep. Lets find out.the pour is indeed thick and black with a coffee collar that stayed for a bit. Nose is coffee roasted goodness with chocolate underlay. Taste is similar with roasted coffee upfront and boozy finish. Feel is light surprisingly, not as much body as I was expecting. Look, it’s good but do think some brewers in Canada have come up with comparables. Rorshach comes to mind as does flying monkeys attempts and third moon. This one has been around for ages and so its reputation has built, but I do feel Ontario can now match it’s prowess.",4.21

L: Pours pitch black with a light brown head that leaves a bit of lacing. A couple of very fine floaters visible. 
 
S: Coffee, cocoa, dark chocolate and vanilla. Dark and smoky with some sweet hints. 
 
T: Dark and malty with notes of coffee and dark chocolate complemented by some smoky hints. Minimal sweetness. Very bitter. 
 
F: Smooth and creamy on the one side. Rather light bodied and drinkable on the other side. Medium carbonation.

Péché Mortel,"11.5oz can received as a gift from a friend. Batch number 69. I emailed the brewery to ask when this was bottled. They said approximately 2013-10-17, so this beer is almost 9 1/2 years old! Interesting and surprising fact - this is a screw-off bottle cap! 
 
Look: This beer is quite dark (black with brown highlights) but doesn't appear to be so thick. There is a very thin tan-colored head around the rim of the glass. 
 
Smell: Nice roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate aromas. A bit of fruitiness and lots of booze. Slightly reminiscent of chocolate covered cherry cordials. 
 
Taste: It's tasty. For me, this has the right amount of sweetness and bitterness. Up front, it's very roasty and a bit fruity, somewhat sweet. The finish is initially mildly sweet, and then gradually shifts to a full-on bitter, chocolatey and coffee-laden finish. 
 
Feel: It's on the thin side for an Imperial Stout, I would call this medium bodied or perhaps medium plus. Appropriately carbonated - not too much carbonation and not too little either. As I take my time to sip on this, it's not nearly as enjoyable as it loses its carbonation. 
 
Overall: It's a very solid coffee Imperial Stout. I had this beer once before either at a bottle share or at home over 15 years ago. I remember being extremely impressed with it then. I'm not so taken with this beer now. I'm not sure if it's because this bottle has a lot of age on it, or because the bar has been raised for coffee stouts and craft beer in general over time. I think that this is not getting a fair shake due to age. Either way, this aged bottle is good (not amazing in my opinion). Then again, my review needs to be taken in consideration given that this bottle is old and that a fresh bottle will undoubtedly taste different and probably a lot better.",3.98

I guess it could be a dessert beer but when its freezing outside and the snow is blowing it'll do. Looks like motor oil with very little head. Just like an imperial stout should. With my diminished sense of smell I get chocolate (imagine that) and malt. Can't decide if its milk chocolate, bittersweet or what but definitely chocolate. Taste is the star here. Chocolate of course but I don't think its too sweet. Nice clean finish I could drink it for dessert but it's fine in front of the fire in the dead of winter. Mouthfeel is almost perfect. Slightly thick, smooth as silk and just about right. Overall, a really good imperial stout.

S: Dark malts dominate the smell on this followed by dark fruits, followed by heavy molasses. The malt is so dominant that I didn't really smell the bakers cocoa/ espresso. 
T: Same as smell intended. The malts dominate the flavor but in the end you can sense the slight bakers cocoa/chocolate, not really the espresso but chocolate. 
F: Very smooth lightly carbonated, not acidic, heavy bodied, thick, easy to drink. 
O: This isn't a bad imperial. I'd honestly rate it the same as old Rasputin with a smoother complex to it as the malts worked in hand with the thick ending with the chocolate. For me the malts were a bit to much. Maybe less malts would be good with the substitution of more bakers chocolate/ espresso. Very well done. I'm curious to know how it would turn out if barrel aged or even added more bakers chocolate to the mix. Very well done!!!",3.98

Look:  
Thick black with a 1-finger creamy light brown head. The head is slow to dissipate and leaves awesome lacing along the glass. 
 
Smell:  
Lightly sweetened medium to light roast coffee. Bittersweet chocolate. Notes of vanilla and a touch of oak. The vanilla makes the brew smell like it has some cream or more accurately creamer (good creamer) in it. A faint wisp of smoke can be detected if one tries. 
 
Taste:  
Wonderfully balanced sweetened medium-roast coffee with a touch of cream and bittersweet chocolate. A nice earthy bitterness is present but is part of the coffee and does not overwhelm. The sip finishes spicy, a bit bitter, but also a touch sweet. Smokiness shows up in the aftertaste. 
 
Feel:  
Smooth and viscous. Some late warmth from the alcohol. The body is medium with a step to the thin side. 
 
Overall:  
An excellent Imperial Coffee Stout. Nicely complex, very tasty, and surprisingly drinkable. The only knock to the brew is its thinner-than-expected body. But that's my issue, not the beer's.

The smell let’s you know what kind of a ride you are about to enjoy. A punch of roasted coffee comes first, followed by dark chocolate, dark fruits, leather and tobacco smoke. 
The taste follows the nose with each aspect getting to shine as the beer warms. Coffee roast, dark chocolate are front and center with some subtle dark fruitiness giving way to a leather and ash finish. All are well balanced.

Mouth feel is about medium, but the texture is more rich and with slight syrup. Good carbonation. 
This is a beer made to display many forms and textures of chocolate, fudge to syrup to milk chocolate balls to bittersweet. Ultimately sweet and best suited for a dessert experience.",4.25

Narwhal,"12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Opaque motor oil color and consistency. Minimal tan head faded almost immediately. Smells of molasses, brown sugar, maple syrup, bittersweet chocolate.

Narwhal,"Purchased at Carwyn Cellars in March 2022. Drunk in January 2023. 
 
Drunk in company so notes are perfunctory at best. 
 
L: Jet black with a thick, dirty white head.  
 
S: Dark, rich molasses with umami/soy undertones. There's a cola syrup sharpness underneath.  
 
T: Very bitter, burnt, dark chocolate with rich caramel and ripe red berries. Some medicinal astringency follows and complements the bitterness well. The beer leaves some harsh bready tones in the mouth after the swallow but again it complements the bitterness and astringency well.  
 
M: Mouthfeel is smooth and a nice counterpoint to the heat and bitterness.  
 
O: excellent beer - an absolute sipper and well worth the time.

Raisin, boozy, maple, toffee, oak, fig jam on the nose. Taste follows, but with some coffee bitterness to go with the fig, raisin, clove, toasted sugar, chocolate.

I like the aroma, the brew smells like bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar, coconut, cherry and oak. Really sweet and malty smelling. For the most part I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some raisin, fig and chocolate flavors. It's sweet tasting but not overpowering at all. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's coating and easy to drink with a low/moderate amount of carbonation. If you're into English style barleywines then definitely pick this one up, I'm glad I did!",4.5

Taste is kind of sweet and proclaims loudly the citrus and pine. Bitterness is noticeable, but not extreme. All fade slowly in the aftertaste.

Trappistes Rochefort 8,"11.2 oz acclimated to 58°F and poured into a goblet. 
 
Pours a murky cedar brown with lighter flecks of sediment drifing around. Has a 1 finger foamy white head, dissipating quickly and leaving a nice film of lacing. 
 
Initial aroma is rum extract and general dried fruit (primarily prune). Maybe chestnut or something else that's nutty? Also present is a sweet dairy smell, combining with the rum extract smell I can't help but think it eggnog or custard. A general Christmas spice can be found, as well as a hint of vanilla. This is a lovely and inviting smell that immediately brings to British/Christmas desserts, wonderful. Agitating conjures a creamy dairy aroma, followed by that rum smell. 
 
Initial taste before swallowing is peppery, vaguely fruity, and slightly sweet, building into some alcohol burn. After swallowing a mellow maltiness comes forward, accompanied by a rum extract note and nutmeg notes, quickly a sweetness builds, joined afterwards by a moderate alcohol burn. I pick up a note of bourbon vanilla further in in the exhale and aftertaste, as well as brandy or whiskey or similar later. The aftertaste remains mostly sweet and dried fruit flavored. Throughout the whole experience I couldn't shake the feeling I was drinking eggnog, which personally I am largely in favor of. 
 
Feel is creamy, almost like drinking thin milk. I find that it flows effortlessly. The carbonation doesn't last, unfortunately, but otherwise the mouthfeel is very nice. 
 
Overall, superb. The only gripe I have is that I found it a tiny bit lacking in flavor. Odd, considering the alcohol content, and I think the flavors present are magnificent, but I yearn for just a smidge more. Otherwise there's nothing negative to say. The whole experience was very enjoyable and I look forward to trying it again. 
 
Will certainly buy again for special occasions, just need to determine which of the 4 by the brewery is my favorite. Will absolutely recommend the 4 as well.",4.17

Consecration,"Served from a tap in a clear pint glass, it's modest biege head didn't last long. The brew is a deep brown-amber, almost mahogany, bright and surprisingly clear for all the color. The only aroma is that almost woody sourness common to good barrel aged ales. The barrel tannins dominate even the Brettanomyces and currants to taste. no minor feat. Yet, the taste is complex enough that they can be specifically detected. There are too many sours that are really some degree of tart. This is also a little tart, but it's unmistakably sour. The woody tannins linger a little too long in the aftertaste. Other than that, there's no complaint here.

Heineken Lager Beer,"I like drinking matching beers to occasions that make sense to me. This was my grandfather's favorite beer, I'm drinking it late night on what would have been his one hundredth birthday. 
 
22 oz bottle acclimated to 48°F and poured into a pilsner glass. 
 
Pours a clear, very slightly pale (pale in saturation not in pitch) yellow gold with a 1 finger foamy white head. 
 
Initial aroma is that quintessential lager smell, crisp with slight hops. Somewhat skunky and diluted to my nose. After agitating it smells a little cleaner overall. A deal has been struck to quench thirst and fulfill expectation, not to excel in any field. 
 
Initial taste before swallowing is a little skunky and hoppy. After swallowing I get a minor amount of hops and bitterness. Sweetness like that in cheap white bread, and maltiness akin to malt vinegar. It's a little dry. Overall, this is a lager that exists. 
 
Mouthfeel is fine, smoother than some I've had but it honestly doesn't do anything special. 
 
I may buy Heineken again, likely not. As stated in the beginning, I purchased it because it was my grandfather's favorite and I'm drinking it to honor his 100th birthday. Maybe as a once a year occasion for his birthday. It's one of those that you need to be in the right headspace for.

RuinTen Triple IPA,"Poured into a goblet: color is amber, transparent, head is off white and presents 1 finger thick, dissipates to a solid top, some lacing and streaking on the glass sides.

Taste is similar with big, bitter notes of hops and alcohol - pine, earth, citrus, honey, syrup, light toast and caramel, some tonicy/herbaly/juniper notes.

RuinTen Triple IPA,"(12 oz can, EJBY 08/13/22; purchased cold single at Shangy's last week... poured into a fat tulip) 
 
L: clear, tawny-colored liquid with perhaps a faint hop haze; cratery, exploded foam sponge upon pour, collapsing quick into a thick, gummy collar... two droopy eyebrows of lace 
 
S: semi-characteristically Stone melange of piney, outdoorsy, juice nectary hops along with a cane-sugar syrupy malty underbelly and moderately strident, tonic ethanol kick... upon further sniffage, an herbal cannabis overtone all day... supreme vibrancy if a bit indistinct in its aroma indentifiers 
 
T: bitter-herbal, pungent hops blasting the palate roof while a jammy, citrusy hop and malt nectar permeates the palate floor with its airy, booze-shocked essences... the aftertaste is leavings of fruit and sugar sweetness with the peppery charge of biting bitterness still attacking the top, even cutting through to the sinuses... it's almost like a Malort and Cointreau-infused strong amber ale 
 
F: resinous, silken, near cordial glory, lithe and luxurious yet punishingly pungent... its glassy, ghostly undercurrent is perhaps (along with its hot sauce fire) its most striking characteristic, as it seems to just float in the ether  
 
O: for all it's brashness, quintessentially Stone in its relentless (to me, fantastic) bitterness, it sports jagged facets of two-dimensional, static, obscure, muddy expressions... I'm somewhat enjoying this, but craving something more characterful, though its tactile sensations are leaving me perplexed and intrigued (1970)",4.33
RuinTen Triple IPA,"Deep gold with decent head. It smells like alcohol and piney hops. Taste is bitter, a little hot, some malt , herbal, piney, with some fruit flavor poking through.

Huge Citrus bitterness and the malty sweetness is almost as huge, call it in balance, I reckon. Alcohol is there in spades but it is not hard to deal with.  
A little bit spicy, earthy, vegetal, short sips are best for me.

Pseudo Sue,"Poured from the 16oz can into a pint glass. The beer is a bright hazy orange color, murky and opaque, topped with a 2 finger fizzy off-white head. I am thinking I will need to fight comparisons to King Sue, but for the appearance, it isn't as ""milky"" as I would have described the other beer. It is a little duller. It looks like a very hazy IPA. 
 
Smell is very strong and refreshing and apparent from some distance away, even when just opening the can. Quite tropical. Orange and citrus rind. Grapefruit juice. Pineapple, mango. Balance upon further inspection in some bready malt within. Some piney hop in the mix, but not as much as advertised or described by other reviewers, in my opinion. 
 
Taste has a bit more of the pine notes, but it also more balanced with a more malty character than anticipated. Biscuit. Honey. It is lacking some of the heat I perceived in King Sue, but that is a good thing. Smooth. Fruit again is tropical with a lot more orange and mango. Tropical notes throughout, but balanced with a dryness. Finishes with a touch of pine. 
 
Drinkable. Accessible. This is possibly a gateway beer that I would introduce others to craft with. But that being said, it is far from bland. In many ways, this is what I want most hazy IPAs to be. Balanced, refreshing, tropical, flavorful. Even (almost) sessionable. I wouldn't call it ""exciting"" (some of the best beers are not) but I would call it world-class for the style.

Yeti,"Black and impenetrable to light. There’s a fingernail of brown around the rim and covering three quarters of the top. Heavy, soapy lacing.

Yeti,"Opaque black color with some ruby highlights and a massive milk chocolate colored head with some nice lacing.  
The aroma is dark roast malt, caramel, toffee, espresso and hints of dark chocolate.  
The taste is dark sweet malt up front followed quickly by the bite of dark coffee, dark chocolate and a blast of herbal hops. This is almost taste overload, massive malt sweetness backed up with serious bitterness from both the roasted malt and major hops.  
The body is full, good level of carbonation, still smooth and drinkable but best for sipping after dinner or anytime you can just relax and enjoy something really appropriate to the name.",4.27

Maximus,"Picked up a tallboy can with a date of 03/07/23. 
 
Pours an amber, copper in color with a finger thick head of frothy foam that leaves lacing on the glass as you drink. Carbonation looks average with small bubbles rising from the bottom. There's plenty of hop residue left in the beer from the dry hopping process. Looks to be pretty balanced. 
 
Balanced on the nose as well with rich, roasted malts and lemon candy hops. Lots of fruitiness in there, though a bit hard to distinguish notes. Maybe some blood orange and mango as it warms. There's a bit of a sweet/sour thing going on as well. It's not overly aromatic, surprisingly. 
 
Definitely hop forward, but remains pretty balanced on the tongue. Roasted malts dominate up front, giving way to the fruity, citrusy, spicy hops towards the swallow but remaining throughout. Picking up notes of apple, pineapple and cherry. The finish is surprisingly mild with some roasted malts and pine on the tongue. Not picking up any alcohol until perhaps the final swallow. 
 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a solid amount of chewiness and subdued carbonation which works quite well. The finish is pretty dry. It does coat the tongue a bit over time but is surprisingly not much of a palate wrecker. Dangerously drinkable at 9% ABV. 
 
Haven't picked up anything from Lagunitas in awhile, thought I would give this one a shot. It definitely has the profile of a classic double IPA, well balanced but also pungently hopped. There's a lot of complexity to savor here as well, especially as the beer warms, but it's also quite drinkable. I'm not a huge double IPA fan, I have them only occasionally, but if the style is part of your rotation this one is sure to please. A very solid offering. Cheers!",3.91
Maximus,,3.85
Maximus,"Look: Pours a slightly orange shade of yellow with a one finger, rocky head of off white foam. Below average lacing. Moderate head retention. 
 
Aroma: The nose is fruit punch like - with notes of sugary orange, pineapple juice and sweet cherry. Sort of anemic and weak, I really have to stick my nose deep down in the glass to get much of anything. 
 
Taste: Surprisingly not as sweet as the nose would let on, and strangely well balanced for such a strong imperial IPA. Reminds me of a dole fruit cup. Upfront I'm tasting some nice notes of bittersweet toffee and dry caramel. Midpalate is rounded out by some nice tropical flavors of pineapple juice and tangy/sweet orange juice. There's a brief flash of shredded coconut and sour cherry. The finish is bitter and resinous, but not overpowering, ending with restrained notes of pine sap and a slight spicy garlic note. 
 
Feel: Alcohol profile is slightly noticeable. Mouthfeel is slightly oily and sticky, but not sugary. Dry/fruity. A touch on the heavy side but not decisively so. Carbonation level is moderate. 
 
Overall: This is very ""fruit cocktail"" like (probably the mosaic hops), it's not exactly my style but I enjoyed it. The first time I tried this beer a year or two ago I didn't like it at all and thought it wasn't even worth rating or reviewing. After having decided to try it again I was pleasantly surprised how my taste has changed. This isn't anything life changing or mind blowing but I'd recommend it if you've never tried it and are looking for a strong Imperial IPA that isn't to that ""slap you in the face"" level of hop intensity and bitterness.",3.65

It poured a snifter full of cloud-white foam, but gave off a spice aroma as I practiced that virtue called patience. As the foam went down and I could finally pour at least to the second pour line, the scent was tart sour. 
The taste was subtle with finessed flavors: a sweetness, back notes of pepper. And hops! All in a light mouthfeel. The aftertaste was of ground cinnamon.",4.6

Orval Trappist Ale,,4.08
Orval Trappist Ale,"Smell is frankly almost nonexistent -- not very aromatic. Some malt, honey, florals. The body, however, is extremely tangy, almost like drinking a sparkling water, with a closely following body of heavy spice, florals, and honey. It's lightning in a bottle, followed by ambrosia. Very unique, very delicious.",4.03
Orval Trappist Ale,"11.2 oz bottle poured into an appropriate glass. Bottled on 7/7/2022 and consumed on 7/16/2023, so this has a year on it. Unknown aging conditions (it was a recent find at a store). Started fridge temperature and slowly warmed to room temperature while drinking. 
 
Look: Incredible head! The beer is a hazy golden color, with one of the thickest off-white heads I’ve ever seen. Pouring this thing is a risky adventure, with overflow a real possibility! The head sticks around for a long time, with tiny bubbles rising through the beer to keep it going long after you’d expect it to fade. Minor-to-moderate lacing. 
 
Smell: Exceptionally unique, so much so that it’s hard to find appropriate words. There is a definite medicinal aroma, but oddly it’s not off-putting. A dry fruity character is present, somewhat (but not exactly) reminiscent of cider. A bit of lemon zest. There’s more, but appropriate words are not coming to me. Many reviews mention band-aids in the aroma, and while I understand where they are coming from I don’t think this is quite an accurate description of the Brett funk in this beer. 
 
Taste: So very dry! As this first hits my mouth the dry, medicinal quality is very up-front. Peppery spice (without heat) is also noticeable. The cider-like aroma shows up in the taste as well, although there’s none of the fruity sweetness you find in a cider. There’s a bitterness that reminds me of citrus fruit rinds. The Brett funk is present in a way that may or may not be enjoyable (I change my mind on every sip!), but is hard to otherwise describe with mere words. 
 
Feel: Exceptionally well-carbonated. I don’t always like high amounts of carbonation, but it works extremely well in this instance. 
 
Overall: As of my writing of this review, this is the #1 ranked Belgian Pale Ale. It’s an exceptionally unique ale, with one of the most interesting and complex flavor and aroma profiles I’ve ever encountered outside of barrel-aged adjunct stouts. The taste is so exceptionally dry I’m honestly not sure if I love or hate this. I do know I’m going to pick up a few more bottles while they are still available in my area, and probably run an aging experiment.",4.23

Maharaja,"Excellent imperial. Very heavily hopped. Crisp and drinkable despite the higher ABV. The hops bites like a snake as you sip it, but it quickly fades away and is replaced by a mild sweetness. There's nothing overly complex going on here. No exotic notes to speak of.

Taste: My first impression is that this beer does taste very boozy. Up front there is a nice caramel malt backbone, which pretty quickly is overtaken by a plethora of spicy and dank hops. The finish is very bitter with tons of pine resin and some grapefruit rind and pith. It finishes on the dry side and it leaves a warming sensation in the chest. 
 
Feel: It has a slick, oily kind of mouthfeel that is also a bit chewy. Carbonated appropriately. It's also boozy. 
 
Overall: This is very much a West Coast style Imperial IPA. It uses predominantly old school hop varieties and its expression is very much old school. I probably had this beer many years ago and I doubt that I was able to appreciate it then. Honestly, for me it's enjoyable yet I find it to be a bit boring. It's not my favorite style of beer, but I can definitely appreciate it for what it is. It's well-made and given that it is three months old, it doesn't seem like it has suffered much due to age. 
 
From the can/website: 
The Maharaja flaunts his authority over a deranged amount of hops: tangy, vibrant, and intense along with an insane amount of malted barley – fashioning a dark amber hue and exquisite malt essence. Maharaja is derived from the sanskrit words mahat, meaning “great”, and rajan, meaning “king”. Much like its namesake, this Imperial IPA is regal, mighty, and dank. With citrusy hops and caramel toffee malts as his servants, he rules both with a heavy hand. Don't be fooled by unassuming drinkability, this beer is potent. Welcome to his kingdom!

Maharaja,"I used to drink this one back in 2014/15 in bombers when I could get it. I recently picked up some cans and although I enjoyed it, did not have the same reaction to what I remembered in the past. The nose on it is what really convinced me something was different. I used to be blown away by just how big and fruity the smell on it was, but the cans were muted in comparison. Still a great beer.",4.22

Look: Old gold body, nice off-white head.  
 
Smell: Pine, floral notes, orange peel,  
 
Taste: Intense grapefruit hops--almost abrasive (in a good way!). Some sweet toffee malts mid-palate, fresh squeezed orange juice too. Clean, citrus-lemon finish with slightest white pepper alcohol note/burn. Wow. 
 
Feel: Very big beer fuller medium to full bodied IPA. 
 
Overall: This beer would be awesome to pair with food. Doesn't make sense to have more than one of these IMO, but this is an awesome West Coast IPA. The kind of IPA that got me into craft beer in the first place--very nostalgic and fun to try. And a pretty reasonable price point to boot. If I can find another fresh batch I'm definitely trying this again.",4.31
Maharaja,This is an amazing beer. I have no idea why the named it after the official beer from India. The Indian made beer is like a nice coors lite. This is a man's beer. Fruity mango. Nice balance between 10% and sweet n bitter. Love it. Get it if you can,4.89
Maharaja,,4.31
Maharaja,"Ok this one is pretty. It's a orangeish copper barely translucent with a white head that settles into a nice cap and leaves lacing all over the walls of the glass. It smells very sweet with caramel bites and a touch of piney mangoes, but it's not as fragrant as expected. The alcohol is present on this one. The gates is sweet and warming up front followed by a nice tropical fruit flavor that compliments the alcoholic sweetness nicely. This one goes down too smoothly for a double digit abv beer. I could drink 2 of these in a row without feeling like I've over done it, which is rare with me and DIPAs. If you see it on draft get yourself a pull but I don't see myself buying a four pack of this.",3.66

Pours a crystal clear dark copper/amber with two fingers of creamy off white/tawny head. 
Aroma is a wonderful mix of citrus peel, grapefruit, piney resin and a bit of caramel malt with a floral note. As warmed there is just a hint of weedy dankness. 
Taste follows with sweet caramel malt - a burst of hop flavours - grapefruit peel, pine resin, some floral flavours and a robust bitterness. 
Medium full mouthfeel, bright carbonation and a lingering bright bitterness. 
Just a treat.",4.46
Furious,,4.15
Furious,"Clear copper with a foamy head that falls into craters. Nose and taste generically remind me of a hoppy amber ale, with a bit of melanoidin and some metal. That metallic not is something I often get in amber ales, especially with a dose of piney hops, which Furious has a bunch of. It’s evident in the first sip late, and moves forward with each sip. The beer overall is a fairly straightforward American bitter beer with a bit of a malt backbone.",4.1

Furious,"12oz can purchased from the fridge as a single from a local bar/bottle shop for $3.50. Canned on 11/29/22, so this is just under three months old. 
 
Look: Dark ruby amber color, clear. Crumbly, rocky, sticky off-white head. 
 
Smell: Grapefruit and very earthy, woody pine resin. Caramel malt backbone. Overall, the aromas seem to be a bit restrained. 
 
Taste: This is a solid beer. Up front, it's pretty tame with a pleasant caramel malt backbone and some grapefruit flavor. Then the profile quickly gets aggressively bitter and the finish is full-on grapefruit pith, zest, and pine resin. The finish is very bitter and very enjoyable. There's just something about the combination and contrast of flavors between grapefruit and darker malts that is so tasty and interesting. This beer takes that flavor profile to the extreme, and it's pretty cool. Over time, I get bitterness from roasted malts coming through on the finish also. Those roasted malt flavors mimic a coffee bitterness, which is pretty cool, and this beer also reminds me of like a grapefruit/coffee drink (LaColombe used to make coffee shandies with Lemon, Grapefruit, or Cherry). 
 
Feel: It has a medium plus body, chewy mouthfeel. it's pretty slick and oily yet it also has a degree of crispness. Nicely carbonated. 
 
Overall: My second Surly Brewing Company beer (Controlled Chaos was the first). This beer reminds me a lot of Imperial Red Ales like Terrapin Big Hoppy Monster and Troegs Nugget Nectar. I think that if this beer was a bit higher in alcohol, then it would fall into that category. And this beer also reminds me a bit of Maine Beer Company Zoe, which is an American Amber / Red Ale.

Poured a velvety black color from a 14.9 oz. can into a standard pint glass with a creamy finger high head that receded slowly and left curtain lacing that clung to the glass as it dissipated. Aroma is earthy and grainy which is fairly standard for the style. Taste is chocolate forward but is not overly chocolaty and has hints of chicory, roasted malts & grain.

Young's Double Chocolate Stout,"Poured from a 11.2oz bottle dated 28 JUL 22 to a diagonally cut tumbler at fridge temp but was slowly sipped and allowed to warm. 
The body is opaque black with a short, deep tan head on top that fades but provides some quickly disappearing lacing.  
Chocolate is dominant in the smell as is the alcohol. Some dried fruit can be sensed also. 
The taste brings the dried fruit out more prominently; cherrys, raisins, all “chocolate covered”. This beer bridges between the sweet and the bitter. Overall the taste is reminiscent of a box full of a fruity alcohol chocolate sampler. 
Mouthfeel seems rather thin frankly, but it does leave your lips sticky.

In Perpetuity,"Canned on 6/30/23; consumed on 7/11/23 
 
Pours an opaque, dark orange body topped with multiple fingers of thick, fluffy, eggshell-white foam; great head retention leaves a half-finger of cap, large collar, and a dense walling of chunky lacing surrounding the glass. 
 
Aroma opens to a waxy Nelson-dank accented with white grape pith as a flaky cereal grain undertone expands; hints of white peppercorn ease through notes of musty lemon and grass on the back end of the bouquet. 
 
Taste brings mandarin peel, grapefruit, and an underlying hint of key lime as musty white grape meets lemon bubblegum over the mid-palate and a flaky grain lingers on through the profile. 
 
Mouthfeel shows a medium body and moderate carbonation, dispersing tautness into silky textures as a slight creaminess prevails, leaving a glossy fade through resinous undertones on the finish. 
 
A steady, well-attenuated dankness rife with tropical overlay; a standard NEIPA in the ever-quaffable Tree House rotation.",3.9

Very low bitterness, with hints of citrus zest lingering on the finish. Satisfying mouthfeel, very juicy.

In Perpetuity,"Look: A mango yellow with a strong white head that dissipates to a glossy surface with a foamy perimeter. 
 
Lacing: A fairly broken soapy lacing. You can tell where each sip ended but no full rings were established. 
 
Body: Literally looks like a glass of orange juice with a subtle head. 
 
Smell: Like a great NEIPA. Subtle and balanced, like a hoppy pine tree accompanied by a well proportioned waft of citrus. A mango/orange backed by hopps smell to be exact.  
 
Taste: Incredibly smooth, no burn, not pungent but a well balanced bittersweet juice taste with a strong fruity citrus that ends quickly with a smooth slight lactose bitter finish. 
 
Tail end: It leaves you knowing you just sipped a top notch beer. Quite possibly one of the best New England India Pale Ales I have ever drank. Its orange juice water in terms of smoothness.  
 
After Taste: Almost non existent other then a slight citrus reminder that ends in a very calm cream ending.  
 
As someone who has drank multiple beers from Treehouse, micro projects to the ninth best beer on this website, I can see how this beer is rated as a 100 after almost 1,000 ratings. This beer is a true diamond in the rough.

Alright, finally time to cross another top 250 Tree House beer! This one is currently sitting at #133. I believe this is only brewed once a year so I’m happy to have made it there when they had it available. Let’s crack if open and see what it’s all about 
 
Pours a hazy pale gold with 3 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing 
 
There’s a nice bite to the nose in this one, leaning a bit more traditional than they usually do. I’m picking up on aromas of overripe cantaloupe, bready malt, peppery hops, orange zest, resin, mango juice, and light gooseberry 
 
It doesn’t quite have the same bite in taste, but I do like it quite a bit. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting overripe mango, white wine, gooseberry, bready malt, grassy hops, light caramel, pineapple juice, and cantaloupe. The swallow brings notes of orange zest, peppery hops, caramel malt, tangerine, gooseberry, light white wine, and overripe cantaloupe 
 
A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a sharp and dry beer. Finishes dry and chalky, really different for them but I dig it 
 
I really like this one. Maybe not quite as good as it’s hyped up to be, but very nicely done",4.39

When I got older I started drinking these and understood why my parents loved them. I hope this beer stays around long enough for me to keep enjoying my childhood.

Curiosity Thirty Two,"Canned on 7/5/23; consumed on 8/12/23 
 
Pours an opaque, sunflower-orange hue capped with two fingers of creamy, eggshell-white foam; great head retention leaves a finger of frothy cap and dense collar, while a generous spattering of spotty lacing coats the walls of the glass. 
 
Aromas of ripe mango are accented with guava zest and pineapple husk, with orange oils informing a peppery dank as a creamy, floral build settles through the bouquet. 
 
Taste brings mango bubblegum into notes of orange and mango as white pepper stimulates an earthier aspect of peach zest over the mid-palate and Orange Tang invigorates the close. 
 
Mouthfeel shows a medium body and a moderate spritz of carbonation, levying a subdued bog to a drying prickle past the mid-palate toward a back end both subliminally resinous and coyly juicy. 
 
An initially tropical amalgam explores myriad hop subtext in a turn toward swampy, earthy rinds before reinvigorating a brighter, cleaner base; a sampling of the Tree House IPA profile at its most comprehensive form.",4.33

Samuel Adams Summer Ale,"This is an okay beer. Nothing fancy, and nothing extraordinary, but it is crisp, vibrant and smooth, as well as refreshing for the summertime. It has no real smell; perhaps faint lemon peel? The taste is faint lemon and citrus notes with a pinch of wheat. Overall, this one is worth a try when in season, iced cold and if you've at least never tried it before.",3.56

Samuel Adams Summer Ale,"Another American-style beer that is overly sweet to my taste, this one resembles a higher-end version of ""Modelo Especial"" or Miller ""High Life."" It does not have strong smells, maybe has a faint hint of citrus, but mostly has a nice easy not too intense taste with a lot of sweetness and a little more alcohol than is normal for this type of beer. I thought it was quite good for what it was, but would prefer less of a confection.",2.22
Samuel Adams Summer Ale,"A medium light haze in an orange-amber golden body. Nose is citrusy - a little more lemon than orange but a mix of both. Taste and feel seem a little watered down after that impression. It’s a little spritzy in carbonation, but fairly light and refreshing with a medium dry finish. Wheat influence isn’t as strong as I’d hoped for and the citrus is a little weak on the palate, with a mix of orange and lemon peel coming out as it warms.",3.57
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"2022 Version 
 
Pours out a very dark brown. On a straight pour, very little foam is agitated out.  
 
Nose is oak, roasted malt, and a peppery quality. Almost like rye spice. If I didn't know any better, I'd say that this was a rye barrel aged stout. Or perhaps even a rye based stout.  
 
On the taste, however, there is more of a story. Oak and bourbon come through first on the palate. Behind that is the roasted malt bringing a dark bread note and a beautiful dark chocolate the sings throughout. I picture an overdone rugelach with a dark chocolate filling in my minds eye with this brew. The only sweetness being from what little is in the dough and the mildly sweetened chocolate. While the oak shows up quickly, it dims down as the palate progresses, and the more subtle flavors appear. Like a tide retreating to show the rocks that sit beneath.  
 
Mouthfeel is fullbodied but not oily or cloying. It has heft, but not the residue that often accompanies. There is drying for sure, most likely due to ABV and barrel tannins. The carbonation is considerable too, for a stout at this percentage. Mild compared to most anything else, but surprising in this regard. 
 
Overall this is what I expected from Alesmith. A respectful, expert brew. The base brew is a hallmark; an example of how often ""less is more"". The barrel aging brings it up a notch while still maintaining that level of composure and elegance. I had no doubt that this would be a world-class offering.",4.6

That's what I'm talking about! After a couple TH beers that seemed noticeably different in overall profile than my memory of them, I was starting to get worried that either they had majorly tweaked something, my memory was failing, my senses were wonky, or (worst of all) that I had fallen prey to reverse lupulin threshold shift. But praise be! That doesn't seem to be the case. This bad boy is dead on.  
 
From the look to the aroma to the taste to the palate, the whole thing just pops and met my standard (unconscious audible groan/swearing) for being nigh-perfect. Solid representation of the style, to my tastes and noticeably a Tree House character. Can't do much better than that.  
 
The nose and flavor are big characterful mixes of sweet citrus, ripe mango with a dash of boozy citrus/lupuline oil aromatics. Like the oil that you can see spray off a twisted rind of the light is just right. The flavor is similar and has a nice bitter but not overly bitter, boozy but not too much finish to it that kind of dissolves into orange rind and makes it take all my concentration to not just plow through the glass. As it warms (and this one started out at cellar temp*) the perfumey/boozy character mentioned above melts into a creamy, sweet sort of character that really ties the whole beer together and sums up that classic estery, fruity, soft, juicy TH character. Simply excellent.  
 
Glad I have a couple more and many thanks, Minor God of Drunken Flannel, for peer pressuring me into buying it.

*- Actually, typing this out I realized this is the first of these recent Tree House beers that came out of my trusty beer fridge (48.5°) and not a normal fridge temps below 40. I think there well could be something to that and my last 3-4 seeming a little lackluster. Lesson to you kids out there that warmer is often better contrary to what Big Beer™ brainwashes us with.

Modem Tones - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Vanilla,"12oz can courtesy of Dimidiata. Been sitting on it for a bit, and decided it would be an excellent Valentine for myself. 
 
Poured into a snifter, it was the color of the mood of Philadelphia Eagles fans right now. Virtually no head besides a very thin line of tan bubbles around the rim. Not a great looking beer, but it's not surprising considering how strong it is. 
 
As expected, it smells like a big Stout brewed with the adjunct ingredients of vanilla and bourbon barrels, with an unexpected touch of what smells like Graham crackers. Smells like a luscious dessert. 
 
Tastes like it smells, but better. It's not a subtle beer, but you don't drink beers like this for subtlety. The bourbon Barrel flavor is fairly mellow and refined, and the vanilla is at a level that melts well with that, unlike a lot of beers I've had with vanilla added to it. That Graham crackery thing I noticed in the nose is present in the taste as well. I do not believe any graham crackers were abused in the making of this beer, perhaps it's a byproduct of the vanilla and bourbon mixing. It is utterly delicious, that's for sure. 
 
Fairly creamy mouth feel, body is somewhere between medium and full. 
 
This is a glorious dessert beer. Perhaps also my last from Modern Times. But, hey, they're going out on a high note with me. Thanks, Christine!",4.56

The taste is simply the nose on PED’s, with the mango leading the citrus deployment for the ripe orange and passion fruit flavor, yet allowing a nice sweet oat flavor to cover the flank.

Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"The beer pours a nice brown head that dissipates fairly quickly while the beer itself is a dark chocolate black with a nice glossy sheen to it. 
 
The smell is absolutely delicious. The bourbon and coffee come out first and followed by a nice mild and soft vanilla alongside a bittersweet dark chocolate. There is a noticeable alcohol note that shines through but doesn't really hurt it that much. 
 
The taste is phenomenal! It has the same notes as the smell with a few additions. The oak note is more present in the taste and lasts through the whole thing. The bitter coffee note comes out first and the bourbon doesn't show up until towards the finish alongside the chocolate. There is also no alcohol notes. 
 
The feel is good. It has a very smooth body with a tingling feeling from the carbonation. It also packs quite a bit of heat for a barrel aged beer. 
 
Overall, this is a delicious beer worth getting and holding for a bit because it definitely tastes like it can develop a bit more fully than it has right now.",4.46

Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Very good head production, but retention is lacking, fading to only the thinnest possible ring around the rim of the glass before long. Body is a lovely obsidian hue, cola-like along the edges. 
 
Aroma is quite strong, prominently featuring the bourbon. Notes of bourbon mash, brown sugar, oak, leather, red grape, cherry, coconut, syrup. 
 
Flavor absolutely delivers on a classic, BCBS-like BBA imperial stout. Lots of bourbon, but not overpowering; moderate char; bitter, but not overly hoppy nor too roasty, coming across on the more restrained side of RIS. Toffee, ginger cookies, raisin, coffee, prune, bourbon, oak, leather, white pepper, blackstrap molasses. 
 
Exceptionally easy to sip, savor, and chew, despite the ABV and barrel influence. Does finish fairly hot on the back third, letting you know just how big it is. 
 
This is an excellent BA RIS, with tons of complexity and an admirable restraint on all fronts. It's supremely drinkable, and less rich than most others, without sacrificing flavor. That said, I personally wish it delivered more richness along with that complexity, perhaps just a touch more sweetness and thickness.

Undated can. Served at 53.4 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 57.7 degrees.  
Appearance – 3.5. 
First pour – Amber Brown (SRM 18), clear. 
Body – Brown (SRM 20), opaque. Under direct light, same. When rear lite, opaque except at the edges – bottom edge ruby, top edge olive.  
Head – Average (Maximum 1.2 cm, aggressive center pour), buff, high density with a few surface rocks, quickly diminishing to a 0.1 – 0.15 cm crown and a thin island. 
Lacing – None. Not much expected at 11% ABV. 
Aroma – 4.25 – Chocolate, weak char, and some hints of bourbon. No hops, no yeast. 
Flavor – 4.5 – Chocolate and slight char with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Bourbon not detected. Slight oakiness. No hops or yeast. No ethanol (11 % ABV as marked on label) aroma or taste. Moderate gastric warming occurs. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl.  
Palate – 4 – Medium, dry side of creamy, soft but lively carbonation. 
Final impression and summation: 4 (After deducting 0.25 point for undated personal container) Look unremarkable, pretty much like every other high ABV RIS or Impy stout. Aroma is fairly typical but has a char note that many lack and lacks the coffee notes that many have. Bourbon is present on the nose but seems absent in the taste. The taste also has both chocolate and char as well as an oakiness from vanillin but lacks the tannin notes. As the temperature reaches the end, some bourbon notes finally appear.

Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,"Brief Review: 
 
O: ""Holy shit, this beer is good."" That was my first thought. I honestly didn't go into this with much expectation other than I knew I'd at leas like it since it's TG and a Sue beer. I didn't love PseudoSue, nor the Galaxy Dry-Hopped version. Thought they were just okay, and potentially over-hyped. Haven't had either in several years. But once I cracked this, I could tell right away it was special. Haze-bomb in the glass. Huge pineapple and mango aromas. Mouthfeel and finish is super rich and juicy. This is honestly up there with some of the Tree House hazy's I had back in the day. Also didn't know this was a Top 150 beer until I looked it up, and I have to say, it's deserves every ounce of the praise. 
 
Recommendation: A surprisingly great extra hoppy edition of the classic PseudoSue. This is by far the best in the line, must-try and not terribly hard to get either.",4.77

Parabajava,"2022 vintage, Drank 08/31/23 
Pours a jet black with little carbonation. Strong aroma of morning coffee with chocolate syrup. Palate is choc covered espresso beans soaked in bourbon barrels. Great mouthfeel, with a gentle sweetness that’s not overpowering and very smooth given the ABV. Absolutely perfect and easily the best BA coffee stout I’ve had.",4.69
Parabajava,"Received as a gift from a kind friend - poured from a crowler (filled on 7/31/23 - enjoyed on 8/20/23) into a snifter. 
 
Clear seal brown liquid rests beneath a beige crust, receding to a thin ring and surface slick. Gentle lacing; slick thin sheen of tears. 
 
Chocolate, fine tobacco, molasses, black licorice, cherry pits, black coffee, and brown sugar in the nose - stupendous. 
 
Boozy, oaky, toasty, lightly charred, with perhaps even more flavor (following the nose) in the finish than on the palate. Wave after wave of malt and barrel complexity. Bittersweet and almost but never quite smokey/spicy. Mild bitterness throughout, earthy/woodsy medium-dry finish with hints of black tea and bourbon. 
 
Slippery, almost oily mouth-feel, with some residual tannins. 
 
Forgot how good the base beer can be, and the coffee adds another layer of roast/fruit/bitterness without distracting from the character of the stout. Wonderful example of the style.",4.51
Parabajava,"12 ounce bottle into a snifter. 2022 edition, had 4/13/23.

Flavors of intense coffee, roasted malt, bourbon, chocolate, oak. Smooth, a solid full body, appropriately carbonated.  
 
The coffee is prominent, bold and outstanding. The barrels show well, the base is solid, the feel is great. Will buy this anytime it is available.",4.45
Parabajava,"2022 vintage 
 
When I first tride OG Parabola I quite enjoyed it, but honestly had higher expectations. And I think coffee would improve upon the base beer, so I’m hopeful for this one. Let’s crack open this legendary variant of a legendary beer and see what it’s all about 
 
Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of frothy tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing 
 
It’s definitely punchy in the nose, somewhere between roasty and bitter white still presenting a nice sweetness. I’m picking up on aromas of cacao nib, earthy hops, roasted espresso, molasses, burnt toast, toasted oak, vanilla, light brown sugar, and tobacco 
 
It trends much more bitter in taste, but that underlying sweetness helps things from getting out of hand. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting molasses, earthy hops, cacao nib, dark roast coffee, plum, rye toast, burnt caramel, light vanilla, and brown sugar. The swallow brings notes of cacao nib, dark roast coffee, burnt toast, toasted oak, black cherry, caramel, earthy hops, light plum, and molasses 
 
A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer. Finishes dry and roasty 
 
Yeah, this is definitely better than the original, the coffee is just the kick it needs. Maybe I’ll get to try some other variants some day",4.49

Notorious Triple IPA,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a two finger white head with great retention and solid lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, orange, mild mixed tropical fruit and pine;a touch of green onion. Flavor is lightly caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, mixed tropical fruit and pine needles. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. So great to find an traditional triple IPA with real malt flavor, lots of fruit and pine and substantial bitterness in the finish. I was struck but the mild sweetness of this one, but with all the mixed fruit it fit perfectly. Some hotness, but plenty of flavor to cover the ABV well. Boneyard has always pleased with IPAs and I'm not sure why I've never seen this one in my area before. I'll be looking for it in the future. Excellent.",4.4
Notorious Triple IPA,,4.87
Notorious Triple IPA,"Look: Nearly clear rich orange with a reddish hue and the pour yields a thick pure white head that pillows up and slowly recedes, leaving great lacing behind 
Aroma: I could smell it before I got close to the glass. Sweet orange, peach, strawberries, pine sap, cantaloupe, a little Cannabis, rich honey-like sweetness, ruby-red grapefruit, Hawaiian bread, tangerine, and an ever-so-slight ethanol waft 
Taste: Whoa. A huge rush of mixed citrus fruits storm onto the palate as honey-like sweetness and berries start to mix in. Pine and dank herb appear from time to time and malt sweetness is ever-present and closes with a big hop bite and alcohol heat 
Mouthfeel: Full, slick, slightly cloying but far from palate-taxing, and decently dry on the finish along with some alcohol heat 
Overall: This is a big-time beer and a good one at that. This was my first time with this beer in years and was pumped when I saw they had finally canned it (or packaged it at all) but glad it’s not around often as it’s a huge Triple IPA and it shows. Tons of hops, tons of malt sweetness, boozy, and unabashedly so - you know it’s big but doesn’t drink like it’s 11.5%. A well done and tasty IIIPA. Recommended.",4.46

Chocolate Rain,"2021 vintage, 20.2% ABV.",4.08
Chocolate Rain,"This one pours a surprisingly thin dark brown that emits a fair amount of light around its edges; brief, cola fizz with no head, retention, or lacing. Nose has a leathery, molasses and salty licorice Black Tuesday backbone melded with semi-sweet chocolate chips. Some vanilla and oak as well. Nothing overpowering, and all the aromas feel like they're integrated into the beer, rather than an adjunct or flavoring that's thrown in on top and feels ""artificial."" Taste follows - it lacks the overpowering leathery and brackish boldish of Black Tuesday, but the cocoa additional doesn't tilt this sweet. Instead, it takes some of the rougher edges off BT while still maintaining an overall ""savory"" (or at least, no sweet) stout. Lots of alcohol, barrel, and bourbon spice lingers nicely on the loooong finish. Plenty of heat as well, but again, not overpowering. I do find the feel a little thing (similar to Gray Monday), but not everything needs the chew of BCBS. I still prefer BT, but this is a fine variant.",4.07

Chocolate Rain,"2017 vintage 
 
It’s been a while, but I’m back with another BIF beer from @Eziel! This guy supplied me with some truly crazy stuff, and I’m hyped to try this one out. I really liked the raspberry cobbler Black Tuesday variant, so I have high hopes for this one too. Let’s dive into it 
 
Pours a surprisingly light muddy brown with a finger of tan head that quickly fades to nothing and leaves no lacing 
 
The nose here is quite pungent, perhaps an artifact of 5 year old vanilla beans and cacao nibs. I'm picking up on aromas of cocoa powder, raisin, dark chocolate, vanilla bean, heavily roasted coffee, hot bourbon, light toasted oak, and molasses 
 
Whereas the nose was charmingly pungent, the taste is a bit sharp and aggressive. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting hot bourbon, burnt coffee, vanilla bean, dark chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, and molasses. The swallow brings notes of hot bourbon, toasted oak, vanilla bean, cacao nibs, black cherry, burnt coffee, toasted oak, and caramel 
 
A full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a sharp and boozy (duh) beer. Finishes dry but with a serious alcoholic heat 
 
Damn, I don't know if it was the age, but I really did not vibe with this one. It's hard to say if it was once well constructed, as it doesn't even really show a shell of what it used to be, save for the aroma. Hopefully the Black Tuesday Reserve he sent me is much better",3.8

Double Shot,"I usually like to sample a base beer before dipping into variants. However, when it comes to TH, I take what I can get when I can get it. So, I tried the Espresso version of this beer before sampling the OG version that is before me now. 
 
Pours a deep dark brown-to-black color with over a finger of head that is milk chocolate in color. Like the Espresso variant, I am not overly impressed by the nose - some coffee, not much else. 
 
The flavor profile is dominated by fresh black coffee. The bitterness off the roasted beans is the highlight here. The body is hearty and the finish has just enough residual sweetness to counteract the bitter coffee.",4.36

Heavy body; heavy sweetness throughout with a mild dryness at the finish.

Smell...A rich chocolate and coffee but faint with a malt back. Molasses and hint of alcohol 
Taste...A rich roasty chocolate malt with almost no hint of coffee. I think that the coffee presence has been quelled or reduced by the nine months on this beer. Anyway a complex sweetness and a bitterness that is definitely overpowered 
Feel...I believe the best quality of this beer. A pesky fullness with the 8.2% ABV seemingly heavier to me. To me this is the part of the beer that I fin craft beers are so superior to the huge stout boys like Founders Sierra just to name a few . The local varieties have a creamier touch 
Overall...This is a sweet stout. I believe the time on this beer (holding it for science haha) has made this beer sweeter than the normal and a practice I would not do to this beer in the future, Still a well made beer but I like a little more balance of bitter. Re-evaluation is in order I believe I liked this beer on the fresher",4.29

A pleasantly warm and roasty, mildly sweet nose. Aroma of molasses-sweetened coffee and bakers chocolate. Dreamy. 
 
Taste is utterly in line with the nose, sparing me the trouble of having to think of new words. Molasses-sweetened coffee and bakers chocolate. A dulce de leche, sort of caramelized milk and vanilla character comes forward with the coffee as the beer sits. There’s an oily, prickly tingle throughout which is as much a taste as a feel. 
 
Feel is thick and syrupy, unctuous, heavy bodied with oily, super-fine prickly carbonation.

Gone is the bright, complex, woody bourbon up front. That has been replaced with a milder, more chocolate front. The middle is “Parabola” in body and flavor. The coffee comes into play as a mouthfeel factor and an end-sip lingering dirty cup of Joe. It’s a decent coffee flavor. It’s slightly odd to me that it comes into focus so late in the flavor. No alcohol burn, and really not much warming as one might expect from this big ABV bomb. For my money, I’d stick with base Parabola or the Anniversary offerings.",4.25

Parabajava,"Poured at fridge temp. Pours jet black with a thin (half inch) layer of light brown head. Tiny bubbles rising throughout the glass. The nose is fantastic. Intense coffee, but a really nice coffee smell. Not cheap stale coffee grounds. This is a fresh coffee smell. I roast my own beans, and this is like dipping my nose in the beans a few hours after roasting. Lovely. Other smells of chocolate, vanilla, toffee, malts, burnt wood, and some brown sugar. 
 
The taste is absolutely insane. One of the best tastes from a coffee stout. Again, the coffee is front and center. A lovely fresh coffee taste. Not overly bitter at all. Dark chocolate, vanilla, marmalade, brown sugar, a touch of maple, walnuts, and salted caramel. The barrel comes through here for sure, but definitely complimentary rather than dominant.

T: Dark rich malts, on the sweeter side, big coffee here mixed in with chocolate. Not getting much cherry in this one as it’s very covered by the malty coffee chocolatiness. Getting some molasses, the dark cherry comes more in the after taste the more I sip and let it sit.

This is not some great IPA, or Stout, or craft beer. This is good ol' Lone Star Light. Its great on hot summer day mowing the grass or hanging at the river. Its a good light beer if you want to drink light after over doing it the night before. 
 
I drink this when i go to concerts at the clubs here in South Texas. You can drink quite a bit and not get F'ed up. 
 
Taste wise its much better than 95% of the Light beers out there. Starts a bit sweet, definite grain notes. Its not bitter, goes down smooth. 
 
If you want a light, easy drinking beer i totally recommend LSL. But, im also biased because im from Texas.",3.4

Yields a night black color with a smaller mohagony colored head. 
 
The aromas lead with ground coffee, honey dipped milk chocolate and matured, spicy wood. There is a leathery quality in this, accompanied by lighter licorice and a note of caramel. 
 
Mouthfeel on this is rich, heavier bodied with a well fitting, lower level of carbonation, which manages to unfold a late effervescence. 
 
Taste offers strong notes of bitter chocolate, roasted espresso beans, dried figs and a well nuanced amount of rich sweet chestnut honey. Reveals an intriguing creaminess then with additional camp fire smoke on top, blending well into the bitter chocolate maltiness in this, together with a lighter note of caramel and mansion dust. Finishes with a lingering herb dryness, blending well into the coffee and chocolate bitterness in this, intensified by the warming, spicy and gnarly oak of the beer.

Lone Star Light,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass 
Appearance – The beer pours a clear straw color with a one finger head of fizzy white foam. The head fades superfast leaving just a trace of lace on the sides of the glass. 
Smell – The aroma of the brew is super light with just a little bit of caramel and malt. Along with these smells comes a touch of paper and herb. 
Taste – The taste begins with a light cracker taste matched by a little bit of caramel sweetness. As the taste advances some paper and a touch of herb come to the tongue all while the sweetness increases just a bit to leave one with a still dry, but light and crisp taste to linger on the tongue. 
Mouthfeel – The body is light and crisp with a carbonation level that is average. The carbonation should be higher for the style to make it more refreshing. 
Overall - It is what it is. I would choose an alternative light lager over this if looking for an easy session.",2.91

Some hazelnut and brown sugar as well. Pretty incredible how much it smells like the dessert. Beer opens chocolate, vanilla, and sweet cream. Hazelnut shell and ash. All the flavors are there but somehow this isn't too sweet. A touch of roasted malt and cocoa powder towards the end just to add a slight bitterness. Barrel throughout that becomes more prominent as this one warms. This is delicious! Body is medium with low carbonation. Smooth and somehow soft on the palate. Sticky and boozy going down with a long, lingering aftertaste. I'm usually a fan of heavier bodies but somehow this works perfectly.

S -- Waves of rich milk chocolate, wet bourbon barrel, prune, fig, chocolate covered cherries, vanilla, maple, and light smoke. Smells like a pastry stout without being a pastry stout 
T -- Incredible how much of a difference 18 months of barrel aging makes over the usual 10-12. The bourbon barrel presence is heavy here -- both in the notes of oak from the barrel itself but also the boozy bourbon heat. Very rich, mapley base stout that has both an espresso/dark chocolate character and a sweet fudginess. The bourbon is just a hair on the hot side 
F -- Big mouthfeel, medium- carb. Lasting, sweet finish. Oily and slick, less velvety than expected 
O -- One of the best barrel aged stouts I've had. Patience is the name of game when it comes to barrel aging, and Hill Farmstead has it in spades. Very pricey @$25/17 oz, but it's worth it

(Feb. 12, 2018 best-by printed on bottle neck) 
 
L: clear yellow, SRM 2-3 tops and so clear it looks like air in the glass, yellow-tinged air; pushes up quickly-dissipating head of white foam that eats at itself like a gose head; bubbles everywhere, and they push up a constant fluffy collar and most of a skin; fun to watch; not stick or lace 
 
S: stale grain, sour grain, yeast everywhere ... loads and loads of dusty yeast; as it warms, hints of cracker malt show up, subtle and lightly sweet 
 
T: grain, stale grain, big corn note midswallow through the finish and it's not creamed corn but real live corn; lots of yeast; over time it gets some of that American adjunct lager housepaint note many of them have ... hard to describe ... might the yeast mixing with other notes 
 
F: that lightweight/heavy carbonation combination us soda drinkers grew to love; it's over carbed of course, but I still like it a lot ... helps cleanse the palate 
 
O: the grain flavor is much, much more prominent than I expected, and while the nose isn't worthy of worldwide acclaim, every now and again you can pick up a pinch of barley malt sweetness; for the genre and at 3.85% ABV, it's fantastic. I don't expect much from an American light lager, and this one easily surpasses those expectations.",3.86

Bud Light Lime Cran-Brrr-Rita,"50 cent 8 oz can out of the bargain basket.  
 
Pours a cranberry jelly color with a diminished head that rivals the length of seeing a shooting star. 80% opaque.  
 
Aromas of margarita mix and lime salt, a touch of ocean spray and 7 up.  
 
Quite strong on the alcoholic presence, with a short-lived antiseptic-like throat spray flavor that fades to a more fruity, light cranberry cocktail juice taste. The alcohol is felt almost immediately in the tummy and the carbonation stings the tongue. Finish has the ripe bitterness of cranberries which may be the only thing genuine here. Ugly dryness rivaling sore throat on the finish, which actually walks in tandem with the throat spray flavor. 
 
Overall the Cran-Brr-Rita is a nice attempt but falls short just as all the other ""beers"" in this line do. Too much antiseptic, only to be covered up by pure sugar and some artificial cranberry additive.

I've made the mistake of having 4 of these in a night. The hangover was far and away worse than what it would have been if I'd consumed the equivalent amount of alcohol in good beer, so be wary of drinking multiple. All in all, this is a serviceable summer beverage.",3.65
Bud Light Lime Cran-Brrr-Rita,"First off, I want to say I only like this drink because it doesn't taste like beer at all. More like juice or punch. 
 
L:4 This drink looks good. Not good as a beer, but good as a drink. Pink like cranberry juice with a small, quickly receding head. 
S:3.75 Again, smells like juice. No alcohol, hops, malt or anything beer-like to be detected. Smells very sweet with some slight bitterness from the cranberry. 
T: Tastes exactly like juice or Hawaiian punch. I can't taste anything resembling beer in this beverage. Very slight alcohol taste. Goes down fast! 
F:2.75 It's carbonated like a beer but the feel of the juice seems too thick to go with it. Kinda lingers in the mouth, slightly syrupy and sticky. 
O:3 It's not a bad drink, but I don't think it's really a beer at all despite the fact it's a malt beverage. I'd drink it if I was in the mood and was offered, but probably wouldn't ever seek it out. Worth trying if you like juice, or wine coolers.",3.32

Game Day Light,"The best way to describe Game Day Light is to use simple words, as this is a simple beer. The flavor can be best described as musty. The carbonation is overbearing and chafing to the mouth. The aroma is of overly ripe fruit (Grapes or plums). It has a strong head... Which burns out to reveal the aforementioned molten carbonation.  
 
However when purchased for a song at 3.99 USD for a twelve pack of cans or even at a slightly higher 5.99 USD it can be a pleasure to drink like water and a painful tincture to imbibe quickly. I can personally attest that after nearly drinking a pallet of this beer it can liven up a party with a lack of beverages very quickly. 
 
If you have to have a beer which you can enjoy taste-wise and you are tight on cash, look elsewhere. A malt liquor might simply be a better choice. If you need a beer that will ensure some intoxication at a decent price this is probably a poor choice, but it is an option which can be exercised.",1.41
Game Day Light,"Pours a slightly hazy light yellow with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, grass, and nail polish remover aromas. Taste is much the same with watery malt and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a poor beer that lives up to the light name with some watery and bland flavors.",2.09

Smells slightly grainy. Taste is sweet and very light. A bit like that sparkling cider that non-drinkers buy for champagne substitute only very watered down. No real hop presence detected. Mouthfeel was thin but O.K. on the carbonation. Overall a beer that was worth every penny of the $2.99 for the 12-pack. A great beer for the people that dislike hops or anything bitter. Cheaper than Coke, Pepsi, and most bottled water. Works out to 25 cents per beer. Wow.",2.65

Tastes just roll off the tounge too quickly, im going to say it tastes a little like lemon, sprite, white grapes, and poland spring water. Tastes a little bit like perfume too, in a bad way.

Lively and foamy head that lingered for a few minutes and dissipated to a 1/8"" film throughout the drink. A surprising amount of lacing. Carbonation was heavy off the start but tapered off and was rather subdued by mid-drink. Smells of corn with a very slight skunk - that familiar Molson aroma that is ever present in every college dive bar I've frequented in Ontario. The taste was surprising: very little of the ""adjunct skunk"" that I know and expect from Molson product. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised with a nuanced flavor with light grain notes, temperate hop bitterness on the back of the tongue and a dry finish - no off-putting aftertaste, either. I purchased this can with the intention of slamming it in a review; I was expecting a boozy version of Canadian. That didn't happen. I honestly enjoyed it.

Smell - No smell other than some creamed corn and the slightest hint of apple skin. 
 
Taste - Virtally nothing, watery, maybe some faint trace sweetness. 
 
Mouthfeel - It is indeed dry, carbonation is a bit too much but is okay with the lack of flavor. 
 
Overall - For a beer that tastes like nothing, yet has 5.5% ABV and is dry as indicated on the label, Molson hit the target the set here, unfortunately it's not a brew worth repeating. Still could've been so much worse.",2.76

Hurricane High Gravity,if you like strong beer this is good on a hot day. it needs to be served cold .. around 36 degrees. taste is almost lager or pilsner but much stronger. i doubt it has much barley malt in it but still tastes like beer. be careful .. this has enough alcohol to be dangerous. and the price is always right.,3.16
Hurricane High Gravity,"On the nose it's a bit like malt vinegar and homeless people urine. Like if you walk around a city and encounter random piss stench.

I almost never spew, but this stuff is a bit hard to get down. 
 
I can drink whiskey all night, but this had me wanting a nap after my first pint. 
 
Edit: This was my warm review. Picked up a Florida six pack on my way to the gym at the dollar store. 
 
Will try this chilled a little later on.

Hurricane High Gravity,"This is my go-to beer because it’s cheap. But it doesn’t taste like cheap beer or water. Any brewer (home or otherwise) will tell a casual beer lover that higher gravity means a higher grain bill (malt and usually more yeast to consume that higher sugar content). Higher grain bill means more flavor. Among AB-InBev’s usual offerings (not including crafts like Wicked Weed here in Asheville), this is the best lager. It beats the hell out of Budweiser, you don’t have to drink as many to sleep well, and it’s cheaper than any other beer at my local stores! Good value for the price! Yes, I like crafts like New Belgium’s Voodoo Ranger Imperial IPA (also produced here in Asheville), but Hurricane is about $8 for 12. Craft beers are at least twice as much. It puts me to sleep without a lot of tossing and turning, and that’s why I drink beer at night.",3.68

Hurricane High Gravity,"This is the best cheap beer hands down for a few reasons.  
Number one is the taste. When I was a heavy drinker I would buy Pitbulls, Earthquakes and Natty Daddys. If it was a particularly rough week I'd have to drink Camo. All those drinks have a terrible sour taste to them that makes you cringe after a swig. The only reason you want to get drunk is to hide the same your feeling. Hurricane actually tastes fine as long as it's really cold. It doesn't have that sour and sickly aftertaste at all (as long as it's cold.) 
Number 2 is the strength. 8% is lower than a heavy IPA, but it's way better than a light beer. It gets you drunk. After a rough week 2 (or 3 if you don't have to wake up early the next day) of these will relax you quite a bit. The drunk is good too unlike some of the super cheap paint thinner cans you can buy.  
That's really all you need to know. The 'look' and 'feel' of this beer aren't important. It's the price, the ABV and the drunkeness. Enjoy!",3.12

Hurricane High Gravity,"Poured from an undated 25oz can into a pils glass. 
 
On the pour I am honestly surprised by a 2 finger fine head. The body has lively carbonation as expected, is a dark straw to gold crystal clear, and is crystal clear. The head recedes to a decent covering and remains relatively fine, some lacing is left. 
 
Aroma on the other hand is as expected for a ""high gravity lager"". Smells kind of like sweat fermented ""green apple"" off notes along with skunk which I guess implies some sort of hopping. An alcoholic note resides at the back along with a vague note of malt. Overall it just smells like yeast that was treated like an alcohol producing slave and worked way past its useful limits with low quality hops and a malt bill that's been watered down with adjuncts, likely rice or corn syrup. 
 
Flavor is quite similar to the aroma with some harsh out of place esters and a hard to explain tartness, behind that a surprising amount of hop bitterness creeps in likely to cover up dirty fermentation notes. Alcohol is detectable and the only positive to that is that eventually the burning and inebriation covers more and more off notes making what malt is present on the finish more and more noticeable as you drink, which is about the only redeeming factor once you actually start drinking. 
 
Feel is at first light any other full flavor AAL but the co2 bit is quite high, and the finish is quite dry but surprisingly drawn out despite the general thinness on the palate. Not the worst but not the best pretty average, but it keeps it drinkable. 
 
Overall it could be worse, but this isn't a very high quality beer. It will get you drunk, it's cheap, and it's not the worst thing that's passed my lips.",2.43
Natty Daddy (8%),"This is the perfect beer to use to bait the slug & snail traps in my garden. I've found that slugs don't generally like the higher abv IPA's, but they gravitate towards this stuff. And the 8% abv knocks them right out to then drown in the container. And at $1.50 for a 25oz can, it's also the least expensive option. So I always have a few cans on hand during the gardening season to thin out the slug population whenever I find that they have been foraging on my young plants. I would never drink this stuff, though. In fact, I feel embarrassed even buying it, and find myself explaining to the bewildered check out girl what I'm actually using it for. Cheers!",1.92

Natty Daddy (8%),"Welp, I can see how the other alcoholics have found this glorious beer towards the bitter end of their drinking cave. It is such a deliciously cozy “end of the line” beer- so high in abv- just chilling there on the shelf trying to blend in with the usual suspects. So cheap, and so easy to find at the grocery store. 
 
I went to the grocery store as it was closing. The registers were all closed. The sliding entry doors were closed. I could only go through the exit. I was already drunk so I was okay with breaking the rules. On my right, as i entered through the exit sliders (which opened right up for me as most things do when I’m drunk, especially when they know they really shouldn’t) were some cases of all the familiar beers stacked up.  
I carefully examined them to search the ABV- my eyes scanning the boxes like terminator- or better yet- bladerunner! Quite instantly, I noticed the natty daddy. The 8% abv glaring at me like a replicant… Pupils not dialating properly…. Or whatever the heck Harrison Ford was picking up on In that scene. I had already read about this particular beer on the Reddit forums for alcoholism. I had an AHA moment when I saw the 8%abv and the attractive low price. Brilliant advertising. It was the easiest choice I have ever made. The ONLY choice. Thank you Natty Daddy. No! I Take it back… THANK YOU Anheiser Busch for providing us with an 8%ABV Beer that we can easily pick up in a 12 pack at the FRONT of the grocery store, BEYOND the checkout lines, when the grocery store is trying to close and has its checkouts and entryways blocked off but there are still stragglers waiting in line and i can sneak in there and buy this tasty and easy to drink poison. AND it’s cheap. Happy Fourth of July.  
 
Overall: it’s a 3.2. A cheap disgusting beer with a high ABV at a great price. God bless America.  
 
**EDIT** :Overall it’s a 3.5. it’s even better when cold! Imagine that. Im drinking the one that I stuck in the freezer which became nice and chilled after I forced down the first one. Im pleasantly surprised.",2.65
Natty Daddy (8%),"I don't have much experience between really cheap high ABV beer, and really expensive low ABV beer.

It isn't pretty but so wasn't that girl you took home last night from the family reunion.  
 
Now as a side note- I did try an experiment with this beer. Got a case of it, mixed it with some vodka, Hawaiian punch, orange juice and a bunch of fruit and damn it made a great powerful jungle juice. May or may not have killed some livers though. Experiment at your own risk.",1.37

Natty Daddy (8%),"Expected this to drink harsh, with the primary peers being Icehouse Edge and Steel Reserve, and of course it drank harsh; this category is not at all for the drinking experience, rather for getting sloshed, so I don’t feel compelled to fault it for that, especially at its price point. It holds up well against IhE and SR overall, all things considered; but that’s really not saying much. However, theres an entirely unwelcome sweetness here that sometimes makes me wish I’d opted for the others. Still, at $1.69 per 25oz in my area, it easily wins against Icehouse Edge and Steel Reserve as the absolute most cost-effective buzz that can be had from beer and nowadays is actually cheaper than soft drinks. Ultimately achieves what it sets out to do, for what it’s worth.",1.88

Natty Daddy (8%),"Poured from a 25oz can 
 
Appearance is not promising on the pour large soda like bubbles that never get over 1 finger and very lively carbonation. Color is a dark straw to light gold. Looks like cheap lager. Head a few minutes in is just a ring around the glass. 
 
Aroma is what you'd expect. Cheap beer. Not necessarily revolting but not appealing. It kind of just smells old and oxidized with a tart slightly off AAL lager yeast aroma. Zero hops detectable. Not great but I've smelled worse, unfortunately not many. 
 
Flavor is not the same as the smell but not better. Very light malt forward but the off flavors creep in quickly. A slight tartness and alcohol bitterness and burn are all present. At first it reminded me of expired. budweiser with vodka in it. As you drink the 8% beer the flavor becomes more palatable. Not terrible but there's a lot off. 
 
Feel is surprisingly easy to put down and the carbonation isn't too intense. The head comes back into existence a bit to give it some thickness and smoothen it out a little. It's drinkable but in the stomach it is quite heavy and the abv makes it a bit ridiculous that in the mouth at least it's this easy to drink quick. 
 
Overall it's bad but not to the point where every sip is regret, and the ABV makes it get better over time. This beer certainly had a time and a place, but generally it's not a great one to be in. It gets you real drunk without being completely disgusting.",2.21
Game Day Light,"The CANQuest (TM) has morphed into an all-CANsuming focus for me in which I will simply drink any beer that comes in a CAN. I have reviewed some oddities before, but beer from 7-11?!? Ah, the memories of the mid-1970's. when we did not have a nearby 7-11 and had to wait for the annual Jersey shore trip to load up on their Marvel Comics Slushee cups ... How my 'rents ever put up with sucking those things down remains beyond my ken. We had a 7-11 in Lancaster, at James and Water Sts. for a short while, but those days are long gone. So's my Pops, in a random memory of the late-70's, on Labor Day weekend, taking my brother and I for the ice cream cookies that were sandwiched between oatmeal cookies and covered in chocolate after watching several hours of the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon. 
 
Crack & Glug Time: My aggressive pour netted me two fingers' of foamy, bone-white head that lasted about as long as the foam at high tide at the shore. Long Beach Island, in case you wondered. The Haven Beach Motel, in Beach Haven, run by Mr. Flynn, of Flynn Real Estate, LLC. Now, where was I? Oh my, but the nose had the grapiness of the G. D. Ice. Ouch and Ooof. That along with a metallic tang gets it an Epic Fail. Zounds! The color was a pale lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was thin and the taste was present but unobtrusive. It was just bland as all get-out. It had a light bitterness but noting beyond that. Booooring! Not bad, but more towards Why Bother? 110 calories? I'm switching back to Corona Light!

Game Day Light,"Served in a Coca-Cola flared pint glass. 
 
While visiting a nearby 7-11, I found myself face-to-face with this oddity. I was compelled to purchase and give it a go. It pours a ridiculously clear very pale straw topped by a quickly-disappearing finger of white fizz. Giving the surface a deep sniff, this beer has the same problem my boy Phil Fry once suffered from: it has no nose. I wanna say there's some watered-down corn syrup, but that could just be the air in my apartment (I think my air conditioner has issues). But, yeah, I smell nothing here, as though water were sitting in the glass. Hm. A taste yields some of that suspected corn syrup (swimming in what seems like an ocean), along with a hint of rice and a slight tinniness (I'm assuming from the can). There isn't much here to be objectionable, but that's mainly 'cause there ain't much here to begin with. The body is infused with helium, with barely any carbonation and a very watery feel. Like I've said before, it mostly seems like water. I have a sneaking suspicion 7-11's screwing with me by selling me a can of flavored water instead of an actual beer.

Overall: Traveling for work, must pick up a beer or three. But the beer selection is not great in this smaller city, so let's try a malt liquor. Hurricane High Gravity is not bad! Sure, it's not my first or fifteenth choice, but it's got decent flavor and no real ugliness that you can get with many high gravity malt liquors.",3
Hurricane High Gravity,"You ever felt down on your luck or had a really hard day at work and was thirsty? Look no further then your local gas station, dive bar, or local beer store and pickup a tallboy size or if offered 40OZ of hurricane. Why did anheuser busch name it Hurricane. Well.. it depends on the batch brewed but your bound to have a Hurricane effect either emotionally, physically or psychologically from drinking it. I’ll leave the graphic effects out. 
 
Nevertheless it is on par with its other contenders for pour, taste, smell and overall quality. Which is in a class of its own. It’s not terrible by any means. If consumed ice cold and drank fast before it changes internal temperatures fast it is worth every penny. If your looking to get drunk fast and you have a few bucks in your pocket this is the go to malt liquor.

And here we are. At .99¢ for a 24oz tall can, my butthole quivers as I gag and shudder with each sip, questioning where my life went wrong. This is the obvious choice for a person lacking any moral compass which evidently there must be a staggering number of considering this stuff is stocked on the bottom shelf of gas stations from sea to shiny f#*@ing sea. Thank you Miller, for not just lowering the bar, but completely dropping it on the floor in the process.",1.26

Look: Best attribute. Dark yellow, straw colored. Would never know the beer is awful from looking at it. 
 
Smell: Here’s where things take a wrong turn. Smell is sweet and very fruity. Reminds me of the smell in a bottle return room at local grocery store.  
 
Taste: Awful. Very sweet. Similar taste to a bottom of the tall plastic cup Bud Light served at a Major League Baseball stadium in 90 degree weather.  
 
Feel: The appearance of carbonation had me expecting a bubbly beer. Instead has a flat feel to it. 
 
Overall: Gets a 2 simply based on the 8% ABV and not awful appearance. I’ve got 12 oz in the pint glass and rest of tall boy probably going in the sink.

Victoria Bitter (VB),"The WORST beer in the world! I am ashamed to be a Melbournian when it comes to this Vile Bile. I remember getting drunk on this turd-foam when I was 17 back in the late 80's. The beer scene in Melbourne was a lot cruder back then, and the variety was pretty abysmal. But hey, we were none the wiser. I discovered Coopers Red back in 1990, and never looked back. Glad to say that now, and just like everywhere else, we have a wonderful variety of beers that I would have died for back then. But - back to Vomit Bombs. I had the misfortune of drinking a Vermin Belch the other day, and I couldn't even finish it. It's like the recipe is - get some hops, bung it in a huge vat made of aluminum, wee into it, stir it around...and wait. About a day. Hey presto! the most pitiful beer every produced.",1.06
Victoria Bitter (VB),"Victoria Bitter. VB. The Virus Beater. The Very Best. The Vomit Beer. Victor Bravos. There's almost as many analogies for Victoria Bitter, as litres of this stuff drunk on a daily basis. It's arguably Australia's most famous beer - piss off Fosters - and is certainly the most popular. There's hardly a pub where you can't find it either in tap or can/stubbie, and the words to the jingle are more well known than the lyrics to the national anthem (is it girt by sea, or gird by sea?)  
 
You either like VB, or you don't. There's no room for sitting on the fence with this beer. It's either something more sacred than holy water, or if your mum was on fire, you wouldn't even use it to try and extinguish her. I used to hate VB, I used to hate the bogan connotations that came with drinking this beer. I used to hate people who drank it. I was a downright snob, and used to look down on people who drank it - especially religiously. But my palate is diversifying, and let's give it a go, to see if I still hate it, or whether it's something that is at the very least tolerable.  
 
Look: This is going to be my 11th beer review, and all but 2 so far have been Aussie adjunct lagers. I will get to the better beers eventually. Poured into a pint glass, we've got a lovely honey gold liquid, clean, filtered. A thin finger of foam has accumulated at the top, but it didn't froth up. It's a little darker than your standard Aussie adjunct lagers, and it actually looks more appealing.  
 
Smell: The classic Aussie adjunct lager smell. Heavy earthy grassy notes come courtesy of the Pride of Ringwood hops, sweet pale malt, slightly sour. Am I overreacting by saying the sourness almost smells like Orange peel? I remember thinking it used to smell offensive. I no longer do. it just smells classically Australian.  
 
Taste: Malty sweetness, nice bitterness. Getting that grassy citrus peel flavour coming through on the bitterness. Smooth, easy drinking. Flavours are mellow, but prominent. Subtle sour tang with a dry finish that makes me want another sip. Slight adjunct taste but not overly powering.  
 
Feel: Fairly highly carbonated, which makes it convenient to slam down that ice cold beer. Ice Cold it is extremely refreshing. Body is medium,  
 
Overall; Either I've lowered my expectations, or I've diversified my palate, and I'm no longer a snob. I can't hate this beer any more. I'm not saying I necessarily love it, but I have grown to appreciate it. It's a part of Australian culture, and it's not going anywhere soon. It's certainly more drinkable than I remember it, and whilst I probably won't go buying slabs of this stuff, I certainly won't hesitate to go for it if I'm at the pub and there's nothing else worth drinking.  
 
Will say, the beer has to be drunk cold. Ice cold. You can't afford to let these warm up,. Once it's creeping up to room temperature, the bitterness from the hops seem to curdle and you get all sorts of nasty flavours going on. That's where I think most people go wrong with VB. It's simply not served cold enough. Most lagers should be ice cold, and ice cold is where the respectable flavours come out to play. Once it starts warming up, grab another one, or just drink em quicker.",3.09
Victoria Bitter (VB),"2004: (375 ml bottle, in Norway.) Sweetish orange-like aroma. The flavour is mostly bitterness - more than in Foster's and Castlemaine, but not really pleasant. Will not be a regular beer of mine this one.",2
Victoria Bitter (VB),"Sure it's just another commercial lager, but with it comes good memories of a broke youngster partying at the local RSL, hence the higher score. One thing it has going for it (for an average to sh*tty lager) is that its slightly heavier in taste, not a totally watered down commercial lager as many are. Would I recommend it, probably not, but if you're in Oz, have a few just to blend in:)",3.35

Easily poundable and inexpensive, on sale, at 10 bucks a 12 pack at Fresco here in Central Florida. Overall, average AF to say the least, though drinkable and not undesirable. For a cheap summertime brew, not bad. Nice and light, with a SLIGHT bit of flavor and hugely refreshing. Although, I prefer Icehouse or Budweiser to this stuff, to be honest. Definitely not my weekend truck washing/ grass cutting beer, for sure, but I would take it over Natty Ice any day. Great brew to try out if you haven't already, but won't be rushing back for more. It's ok if ya get it on sale. Worth a shot.",2.75
Famosa (Gallo),"Shared bottle at local tasting, as Famosa. Pale golden colour, low white head. Artificial and ""chemical"" sweetish / sourish aroma. Sourish flavour, otherwise bland as hell, dust, no bitterness",1.38
Famosa (Gallo),"Funny that this is rated as awful. For what this is and the travel it goes through as well and the unique quality it has over other beers from its region make me question if reviewers are simply saying it's bad because it's not an imp stout or ipa.  
 
It looks like every other adjunct lager yes. But the smells are spicy and herbal underlying beneath a cracker base. The flavor follows the nose and is pretty unique given the region and style it comes from as previously stated. The feel is light enough and inoffensive.  
 
If you are comparing this beer to American craft beers then you're doing it wrong. If all you drink is a Dipa then why even bother with this. From a point of view of this that's why I believe the rating is low. If you like clean lagers then this is a great beer.",3.73

Sol,"Poured from a 32oz caguama bottle best by January 2023 
 
On the pour, fizzy looking bubbles come together to make a one finger head that quickly dissipates to a surprisingly fine covering over the top of the beer. The body is a light gold with lots of carbonation and some very light lacing. 
 
Smell is very light and almost not there, bit what I can pick up is just corny malts and some skunked hops from the clear bottle. At least it's clean apart from being light struck. 
 
Taste is a bit of a let down. Once again very light. Right on the very first sip there is a hit of bitterness that implies hops but that quickly fades as you drink and get used to it. There is a certain minerality and tartness as well that lingers until the malts fully take over about halfway into the sip. The hops don't taste fresh at all and are only providing bitterness and grass flavors. One again very clean with almost no yeast notes. 
 
Feel is actually decent being very drinkable and has some actual body to it although it is still very light once you get past the carbonation and head stage of the sip. The finish isn't as short as I would've expected for a beer this light amd it leaves you feeling malty and a bit boozy for a decent while after your sip. 
 
Overall it's alright. You can do better from Mexico, but it's about on par with all the other clear bottles that come from down there. Victoria and Tecate are both better and Tecate is the same style too.",2.84

Budweiser 66,"A 300ml clear glass bottle with a BB of March 2013. The label states that it is brewed in the UK, and describes it as lightly carbonated with a smooth, easy taste. Sounds like bollocks to me. 
 
Poured into a straight pint glass. A clear pale straw colour with light carbonation. A hard pour results in a large head of white foam that disappears rapidly. Aroma of almost nothing; initially some faint malt and little else. As it warms, unwelcome hints of stewed corn and sulphur appear. Gross. 
 
Tastes of ultra-light malt with a faint sweetness. No hops or bitterness whatsoever. This could well be the most flavourless beer I've ever tried. Mouthfeel is thin and watery, with a mild tingly dryness. No body - could pass as mineral water. A weak aftertaste of stewed veg. 
 
Crap. This has to be the blandest, most characterless brew ever to pass my lips. Almost no taste, a weak and unpleasant aroma, and no body or depth. Just bad on every level. Avoid at all costs!",1.8
Budweiser 66,"A - Very pale yellow with absolutely no head at all. A couple of tiny bubbles rising to the surface too but not many. 
 
S - Hardly any smell at all, mainly a very faint sweet smell but bland for the most part. 
 
T - Very bland again for the most part although it finishes with a sugary, sweet kind of taste. 
 
M - Very light bodied & smooth going down with very little carbonation. 
 
D - This beer has absolutely no taste other than a very faint, sugar like finish & the fact that there was no head at all when I poured it suggests it should be avoided. It tastes so much like water than I wouldn't even call it beer.

Budweiser 66,"This beer is brewed for the UK market only (I am lead to believe), God knows where it is actually produced. 
 
Clear 300ml bottle, the cap already promised to a BA in the US. 'jermsumm' gets it in my next package. 
 
The brew number is a special one, it means something to a lot of British people, which is obviously why Bud choose 66. 
 
When a Brit hears the number 66 it reminds him of different things, depending on age and education. 1066 The Battle of Hastings, where we defeated an invading French army: 1666 The Great Fire of London, 1966 When England won the football World Cup for the first and only time, or the iconic Route 66 from Chicago to LA: However, a number between 65 and 67 is what it'll mean to most who buy this beer (if they can count that high). 
 
I poured the beer into a Hoegaarden Crand Cru stemmed tulip glass to give it some class (this failed to have the desired effect). 
 
It looked like a regular lager/pilsner/helles, golden clear, clean and bright. The white head leaving before it had fully arrived, a trait I hate. 
 
You'll not be suprised to hear the beer had very little aroma or taste, in fact it reminded me of fizzy water such was its characterless, gassy, flavourless make-up. Perhaps I'm being unkind here, hey, no I'm not, this beer is terrible to the core (if it had a core to be terrible too). 
 
There was a mini hint of sweetness from something, but I couldn't detect any hop, malt or yeast involvement what-so-ever it this so called brew. Most likely the worst beer I've ever reviewed since joining this site.

St. Pauli N. A.,"12 oz bottle poured straight from the fridge into a nonic. 
 
Pours a medium gold with a 1.5 finger staying white head, leaving a good film of lacing. 
 
Initial aroma is very much skunk and marijuana, even upon opening the bottle. Other than that all I can really say is it smells like a lager, years and crisp. 
 
Taste is very much sweet malt with some bitterness and not much else. The sweetness is surprisingly very high, being slightly fruity but very much a caramel malt flavor, tasting light in color. The aftertaste comprises strongly bitter hops and the afformentioned sweetness, both present on the back of the top of the tongue. 
 
Mouthfeel is thin and watery, but also crisp and slightly fluffy. Honestly not bad despite the drawbacks. 
 
Overall not terrible but nothing to write home about. It's a macro. 
 
Not going to buy again, but worth it to try once.",2.39

St. Pauli N. A.,"Appearance - Pours clear and light yellow with a white, half finger width head. Not much for lacing. 
 
Smell - Light skunk, malty sweetness and faint whiffs of grain and grass. 
 
Taste - Follows the nose. Cereal malt sweetness, slight grain and a touch of grassy hops. Sweetness dominates the aftertaste.  
 
Mouthfeel - Light in body with moderate, bitey carbonation. Slick drinker with a crisp finish.  
 
Overall - It's okay for what it is, but the sweetness makes it hard to drink more than a few of these before moving onto something else.",2.84

S: somehow a little skunky, wet coins and/or vinyl siding, wet forest, hint of doughy, biscuity malt 
 
T: all of those aromas are pretty much exactly what I get on the palate, with the malt of course opening up, taking over the flavors... bit of back end grassy bitterness and perhaps a hint of toasty smoke that helps establish a little balance and depth 
 
F: medium-bodied, a bit sluggish flowing through, but ends with a nice tickle of carbonation, giving way to the soft stunning hum of hop bitterness... about standard for its ilk

Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,"24oz can, let's see what I did to myself... 
 
One the pour 1 finger of bubbly white head formed with surprisingly decent retention, leaving a thick but sudsy ring and a slow dissipation to a thin covering on top. Body is a golden yellow. As expected, no lacing.  
 
Aroma is bad like the cheapest oldest bottle of Sutter home white wine in your local shitty liquor store. It's almost tart. Acetaldehyde for days and hints of vinegar. 
 
Taste is of course an amplification of the aroma, but even dirtier. Sweet shitty rosé without the refreshing vibe, that then transitions into a lightly malty finish with a dirty bitterness that thankfully doesn't grow. The aftertaste is like wine puke. 
 
Feel is at least drinkable, but the knowledge of just how terribly made this is makes my body want to reject it. The only way to drink this beer is to take big gulps, but thay could lead to intestinal distress. At least you can chug it without completely hating yourself, at least completely.  
 
Overall this is bad. Just buy steel reserve, or at least go for the 12.2% alcohol version if you really need to get wasted... and why the hell does this taste like what my palate in high school tasted dry white wine as, but sweet..

Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,"The top of my can says ""Special Reserve"" ok who are they kidding, this is hands down a bottom of the barrel malt liquor. I cracked my can and poured an 8 ounce glass full because I needed to see straight into the eye of the evil hidden behind that aluminum can. Pours a dark yellow color with a thick head and constant heavy carbonation. The aroma is revolting, the mouthfeel makes me a little woozy, and the flavor is simply horrific. Overall this ""strong lager, a.k.a. malt likka kikka is a tough sell for me, because even if I was looking to get a quick drunk on this beer (term used loosely) is tough to drink. Be afraid, be very afraid!",1
Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,"Since no day is a good day to subject myself to Malt Likkapalooza IX, this day is as bad as any other. For today's bout, this big silver can of Camo 900 will be going up against Lucky Number High Gravity Lager. Is it possible that Camo 900 High Gravity tastes different than Camo High Gravity, Camo Silver Ice and Camo Black Ice? Only an idiot would do a 4-way malt liquor comparison tasting. Hmmm... 
 
Camo is urination yellow (if the hobo is dehydrated), with an off-white lid that is, by far, the better looking of the two. This stuff is actually beginning to deposit some lace on the upper reaches of the glass. Who put a good looking beer in my can of boozy malt liquor? This might be the best looking beer of this style that I've ever seen. 
 
Neither one of the aromas is overly offensive. This one is sweet and corny, with a semi-pleasant floral fruitiness that none of its typical imbibers is likely to appreciate. No great shakes, but doable given what style we're dealing with. 
 
Will wonders ever cease? I didn't think very highly of Camo Silver Ice (for good reason), but this stuff is drinkable if your expectations are in the correct place to start with. The flavor is as simple as a stone and isn't as... ahem... pleasant as the nose, but it ain't bad either. As always, being ice cold helps. 
 
The body/mouthfeel is a bit lighter than the style average and has a 'just right' amount of carbonation. A soft fizziness hits and is then gone, allowing the beer to melt in the mouth with a smoothness (relatively speaking) that is unusual in a malt liquor. 
 
Either 'Special Reserve' Camo 900 High Gravity Lager really is better than Camo Silver Ice or I'm in a malt liqor-receptive mood today. Scary thought. Anyway, Malt Likkapalooza IX wasn't even close. This stuff almost makes me want to go out and buy some brown paper bags.",2.51
Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,"Jeez this is a ""Special Reserve"" beer. What is the reserve a bed in a poison control center? 
 
The pour from the Ghetto sized 24 Oz can gives you a brew best describes as ""first piss after the beer fest."" Clear and yellow with a questionable white froth on top. 
 
Smell is sweet corn and fruity ester funk that I normally smell in Dogfish Head beers. Matter of fact this smells exactly like DFH Liquor De Malt. And I do see that I gave Liquor De Malt a 3.5 in smell so... 
 
Taste is weirdly unflavored, just some apples and alcohol burn. Near tasteless alcohol delivery device. 
 
Mouthfeel is water plus vodka. 
 
Drinkability is.... Subjective. There are FAR nastier malt Liquors out there and I have tasted them. This is meant for just two types of people HARDCORE alcoholics and College Students...More or less the same thing in some places.

Poured into a Jever Pilsener glass, this was a chill-hazed, slightly amberish golden color, with a miniscule white head that receeded to a thin collar in seconds. Despite the lack of head there's lots and lots of bubbles arcing skyward. No lace at all. 
 
Big, crude grainy aroma and hints of white wine, so 50% what I expected and 50% WTF. 
 
Grainy malts with a side of diacetyl. Yum... 
 
Light bodied, but not as light as it should be. Lousily low level of carbonation.

Michelob Golden Draft Light,"Poured from can into a pint glass 
 
Appearance – The beer is pours a light golden color with a billowy white head of fizzy foam. The head fades very fast to leave a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. 
 
Smell – The aroma of the beer is light overall, but consists of some cracker and bread as well as a bit of corn and caramel sweetness. There is a little bit of light hop as well as some light papery aromas. 
 
Taste – The taste begins light and crisp with a cracker and lightly corn and caramel sweetened taste. The tastes are light upfront (appropriate for a light brew) and continue so throughout. There is a little loss of sweetness as the taste advances and along with some increases in a grassy hop and a little bit of grainy malt flavor, one is left with a light and crisp taste to linger on the tongue. 
 
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is quite light and thin with a carbonation level that is high. For the light brew style the feel is great and makes this an easy drinking session style brew overall. 
 
Overall – For the style this is a rather decent light adjunct. Not super flavorful, but low cal, easy drinking, crisp, and sessionable.",3.2

It is thin and lacking flavor,(but we are talking about basically a 3/2 beer) For what it is the ratings do not reflect the quality. High ABV stouts (even crappy ones) get above a 4 if the ABV is Above an eight. I am judging this for what it is. A weak,3/2 beer.",3.64
Amstel Light,"L - Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Sam Adams Perfect Glass. One and a half fingers of light off white head on an aggressive pour. Fades to a lightly foamy film. Lacing shows on agitation, but quickly returns to liquid. Lots of carbonation showing from the nucleation in the glass that is easy to see through the clear light straw color. 
 
S - Honey and crackers up front. And that's really it. 
 
T - Sweet honey and bready cracker taste follows scent. Maybe even some hints of cornbread. Very very minor crispness in the middle, but really muted and fades fast. The sweetness of the flavor is pleasant, and not skunky at all like some other reviewers have experienced. No real bitterness to speak of. 
 
F - Thin mouthfeel like other light beers, but not total water. A nice amount of minor carbonation. Very easy to drink 
 
O - Overall, this is one of the better mass produced light beers I’ve tried. It actually has a palatable and pleasant (if not straightforward) flavor profile. At this time, I’m not normally reaching for light beers, but if I had to choose a light beer, this would be the choice for now. Perfectly refreshing for outdoors and camping.

I guess the thick body and overly sweet flavor are worth struggling through if you aim to get smashed.",1.57
Camo 900 High Gravity Lager,"Camo 900 High Gravity Lager pours a classic lager amber from a 24 oz pop top can. The light tan head went over two fingers before turning rocky then settling down to a fine carpet of foam, leaving a fair amount of lace along the way. Plentiful streams of carbonation are rising to replenish the cap of foam in a seemingly endless supply. 
 
Nose is a sweet corn with a floral component followed by the vapors of alcohol. Palate is a very sweet corn with some hops bittering, not quite in balance with the very sweet corn, the hops bittering offsets some, but not all of the sweet corn. Missing is the burn from the 9% by volume alcohol, it is tucked away in the same place as the bite of carbonation, in the viscus liquid of this HGL, the mouth feel is that of a light syrup. 
 
In the end, the sweet corn becomes cloy, the bitter has lost the battle and is nowhere to be found. The sides of my glass are still covered in a fine lace. A good deal of ambivalence is going on with the eye candy and the cloy sweet corn. 
 
For me, its one time around the block... for some one else, Im not so sure.",2.07

Its got a sweet taste, again, I almost think of apples even tho its clearly not in the taste pallet but still... You can taste the hops or grains for sure so that ads to the authenticity of the lager.

It tastes like mineral water and cardboard, there’s no distinct hop or malt profile I can detect. That being said, I’m not planning on drinking them by themselves.

When Frio Light first hit the shelves here, I bought a six pack of 16oz. of it, and it was amazing-it tasted like a poor mans Belgain Triple! Not too long after that I bought another 6 pack and it was flat out putrid and undrinkable. They seem to have stabilized the quality control of int to where it is generally a disagreeable pretty poor swill...that said, I really am of the firm opinion that QC , or more precisely the LACK of QC,is integral how this beer may present at any given point in time...I mean, with the more expensive American Adjunct Lagers you get precise consistent product. Case in point, I just bought a 30 pack of this Frio Light and it presented as a interesting AAL akin to a Pabst, or maybe the dregs of the barrels of some very good beer? 
All that said, I think , and I am of the opinion that, when the beer travels all the way from where it is brewed in Memphis Tennessee by ""Quality Brewers""( that.s what the can says despite being said in the headliner of review page it is made in Wisconsin by "" City Brewing"") in hot truck (broiling hot actually in the summer), it can and will ruin the beer. Maybe tha's why the stuff I just bought here in December tastes pretty good, in fact, I rate it a solid 3 right now.",2.95
Frio Light,So this is a good cheap beer running about $20 for a 30 in texas. Tastes very similar the Coors Light and is a good going to a party budget buy.

All around a good beer for those that dont want to spend $10+ a bottle for micro brew.,2.77
Frio Light,"Appearance: 
Pours to thin head that laces a bit. Pale clear straw color.  
 
Aroma: 
Smells of sweet syrup, candy corn, overripe pears and apples, and a hint of solvent. Very cheap smelling.  
 
Flavor: 
Flavor is just plain ""off""-- candylike and not very much like a real beer. Almost like a non-alcoholic brew, except you can detect the alcohol through the thin veil. Tastes of chemicals. Aftertaste liuke cheap waxy candy or artificial sweetner. Yuck.  
 
Mouthfeel: 
Light and bubbly. Moderate CO2 (about 2.5 volumes). No astringency. Watery but quenching.  
 
Overall: 
Tastes weird, not enjoyable. Even at the rock bottom low price point, it is pointless.",1.54
Frio Light,,2
Frio Light,"Poured into a nonic pint glass. 
 
Looks like a classic cartoonish beer with huge white sudsy head and clear golden body. Smells like damp corn husk, cardboard. Tastes fairly neutral with a little bit of corn adjunct and slight metallicism. Mouthfeel is light and fluid. 
 
Overall, not spit-out bad, just plain and watery but not in a good way. If I want plain and watery in a good way I’ll drink Natty Light.",2.81
Frio Light,"I received this CAN from my local, in-person trader, tone77, who always come through with unexpected and surprising additions for The CANQuest (tm)! This is just one more exCANple of his ability to suss out new CANned beers. 
 
From the CAN: ""American Brewed""; ""92 calories/2.8 carbs""; ""Premium Pilsner Brewed and Canned by Quality Brewers, Memphis, TN"".  
 
I got some foaming through the vent when I initially Crack!ed it open, so I quickly CANmenced a Glug into the awaiting glass. Unbidden, it formed just under three fingers of foamy, fizzy, rocky, bone-white head with very limited retention, quickly falling to wisps & leaving only a trace of lacing behind. Color was Straw-Yellow (SRM = > 2, < 4) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had an odd maltiness, not of an adjunct like corn, but instead almost like wheat, slightly honeyed. Hmm. I have smelled MUCH worse in/from the style. Remember to review to style, not to taste! Mouthfeel was thin & watery, about par for the course. The taste was really bland, barely registering as anything more than fizzy water. The site's style guidelines read: ""The hop character is low and should only balance with no signs of flavor or aroma."" Agreed. It was pretty close to flavorless, but the smell was at least noticeable. It would be hard to rate it as ""Poor"" in that case. Finish was quite dry & refreshing, but it was a decent beer in a crappy style. I suppose that it would be nice on a hot, humid Summer's day, but then again, so would a glass of water. YMMV.",3.08

The smell is dry malt with a caramel touch. There's a bit of cardboard to the nose as well. 
 
High carbonation level with not enough body to balance it. Despite this, this beer is too sweet, cloy even. There are overtones of apricot and caramel, but it isn't appealing--too dessert like. The hop is nearly nonexistent which is unfortunate since this beer needs balance. Think double bock without the body or rich malt presence. A clear miss.",2.34

Kirin Lager,"May 2002: The bad thing about living in Norway is the price of beer. The good thing, however, is that those of us who live near the coast and have a small boat (yes, like me) can catch our own seafood - for free. Today's freshly caught crab was my chosen accompaniment with Kirin lager - a good choice, I believed, as the Japanese love seafood more than anyone else in the world. I'm sorry to say that most European pilseners / light lagers would have been a better choice than this one. There is very little aroma, the beer is dry (which is a good thing when you have it with seafood) but some more flavour would have been good too! - aftertaste is metallic.

It was so bad we decided rather than drinking it, we would use it as target practice. The ammo cost more than the beer. It was the best use of ammo in human history. Forget Gettysburg.

Well I went home and distroyed my entire house for no reason and couldn't even remember doing it, but I was the only one home!! SMH",2
Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,"Purchased a 24 oz can for $1.29 including beverage tax at a gas station in Dayton, Ohio. 
 
Look: Straw yellow color, medium head. No lacing. 
 
Smell: Strong sweet smell, green apple and malts. 
 
Taste: Very, very sweet. I can barely taste any alcohol. Was actually disappointed by the lack of graininess since I genuinely love a good AAL. Virtually no hops. Remarkably inoffensive for the high alcohol content, but no character either, almost like beer flavored soda with less carbonation and some alcohol. The sweetness is just WAY too much, even for a malt liquor fan. There is still some fusel taste, but it is masked by the extreme sweetness. 
 
Feel: Very light body, even lighter than *only* 8% abv cheap lagers like Steel Reserve and even the watery Natty Daddy. Weak carbonation, which means you can chug easily and get drunk very fast, which may be dangerous with a beer of this ABV. 
 
Overall: My previous review was more positive, but honestly I can't recommend this beer for anyone. As a malt liquor, it is terrible even compared to the usual high gravity brews, and seems to be targeting the alcopop crowd with its excessive sweetness, but won't please anyone except those looking for the fastest buzz from a beer. Interesting because it pushes the limits of what is considered beer, but even Earthquake is way better. Stay away!",1.48

Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,"24oz monstrous can, procured during happy hour at the Pizza Brew in Calgary. Stereotypical inner city brick wall graffiti imagery makes up the childish label.  
 
This beer pours a clear, medium golden yellow colour, with one fat finger of puffy, somewhat foamy bone-white head, which leaves some stringy webbed lace around the glass as things quickly move southwards. 
 
It smells of that standard Minhas house essence - musty dank cardboard, industrial effluent, apple cores, and an acetone-heavy metallic booziness. The taste is more of the same - wet paper, a suggestion of grainy corn malt, industrial park alcohol, adult bubblegum (i.e. boozy), apple mush, and very little else - but that's not the point here, is it? 
 
The carbonation is soft, but fairly frothy, the body medium-light in weight, smooth like vodka after that initial burning sensation wears off, and airily creamy, for some reason. It finishes sweet, all surprisingly restrained alcohol heat and bland apple fruitiness, like a cheaply boozed-up cider. 
 
Strangely not the most off-putting, or awful-tasting offering from this brewery - sure it's alcoholic, but it bears that badge with pride, and a pleasant enough softness. Other than that, however, this is indeed the lowbrow shit you might take it for, all other things being equal.",2.11

Faxe Extra Strong,"500 mL can from the LCBO; dated May 23 2022 and best before Aug 21 2023; served well chilled. This is review #3000, so I had no choice but to go with the biggest doozie I could find. 
 
Pours a clear honey gold colour, crowned with nearly two fingers of frothy, foamy white head that dissipates within three minutes or so. A snaking band of delicate lace is left behind, in addition to a soapy collar surrounding some filmy wisps on the surface - looks safe enough. It smells of alcohol, corn syrup, green apple skin and barley malts, with faint hints of acetone, banana chips and pears. Not great, but not entirely objectionable. 
 
I gotta say, I am a little impressed at how tolerable this is. Corn husk, honey sweetness and lots of grainy barley malt, as well as a relatively low-key booziness that is ever-present throughout the sip. Fruity hints of apple and white grape crop up briefly, but don't last; the finish is corny-sweet and boozy, with grassy, dirty hops echoing into a malty, boozy aftertaste. Mostly lacking the fusel nastiness you get with really bad examples of this style, but it does numb the tongue a little. Medium-light in body, with low carbonation and a light, airy texture juxtapositioned with a slick, clingy mouthfeel. I'm not 20 anymore, but if I were this'd make a good pre-drink before hitting the bar or club or whatever. 
 
Final Grade: 3.11, a passable C+. Every thousandth review, I pick out a 'dud' - i.e. an arguably crummy beer that I have avoided reviewing previously. I'm not going to pretend that finishing this can of Faxe Extra Strong wasn't a chore, but truthfully, this is not even close to the worst strong Euro lager I've stumbled across. I think it's one of the better ones - I'd easily take this over any of those Bavaria 8.6 beers, and it blows all of the other 10% Euro lagers I've tried out of the water. Realistically, I have no excuse to ever drink this again, and their Fest Bock is a much better beer... but Extra Strong still earns my tacit, grudging approval, plus a recommendation as a respectable example of its style.",3.11

10% 'quality lager beer'; black can, red/gold/white branding (different label than what's pictured here)... slightly hazy (decomposing), amber liquid; ample foam build with each pour, and it actually collared and laced a bit... on the nose: fusel-kissed medicinal spice, barmy yeast, artificial fruit aroma undertones... on the palate: Wells Banana Bread beer, nuttiness enhanced, dried out and fortified/tainted with cheap, rotgut ethanol... textures: brief, round swell up front, dropping clean in the finish aside from a mild oily warmth, but no burn; delicate tickle from the aforementioned spice/nut elements; mild effervescence 
 
summary: almost 12 years to the day, I finally found another beer with a nearly identical flavor profile to that of the Carlsberg Special Brew I had at the Prince of Wales pub in Aberdeen, Scotland; blown away: memories, reminiscence, flashbacks flooded my mind... that said, this isn't a spectacular swill (but I'd love to try a fresh can), though it's remarkably drinkable because, dang, I did end up finishing the whole can somehow (pacing?), and experienced no recoil from beginning to end...

Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,"Okay, this is not a beer to trifle with. If one were to drink a 24 oz. can of this and then drive a motor vehicle, then he would be almost guaranteed to get arrested on a DUI charge. I drank only a 12 oz. serving (on an empty stomach) and was thoroughly drunk. Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor has a thick, off-white, creamy head and a deep golden appearance. I was amazed by the abundance of ragged lacing. The can design is completely politically incorrect, and it nuances all the wrong things about malt liquor. But, for those of us who enjoy cruising the underclass of the beer world, it is an interesting beer. No, this is certainly not the type of beer I'd drink on a daily basis, but, for kicks, I am enjoying the ride (so, please excuse any inebriated verbiage). Four O has a strong apple aroma and some grain can be detected in the smell as well. The taste is highly sweet and fruity, with some alcohol sting to it. Mouth-feel is rather heavy, and this concoction finishes wet and sloppy. Put it to you like this: if all you care to drink is Busch, Budweiser, Miller High Life, Shiner Bock, and Coors Banquet, etc., and you don't appreciate the ""wild side"" of beer, then don't fool with this stuff. But, however, if you like to go into forbidden zones from time to time, I'd recommend you try this (with extreme trepidation, to be sure). Well, for those who relish trying outlandish, unacceptable drinks like this, I'd recommend a try (at home, with an iron-clad assurance that you will not, under any circumstances, operate a motor vehichle). Although you may not like this beer, you can't really argue that it's not interesting.  
 
UPDATE NOTE: About an hour after writing this review, I was hit with a nausea that lasted over 24 hours. So, that's what I get for going out on a limb and sampling this filth. I really can't, with a clear conscience, recommend this trash. My advice is to stay away from it and not damage your psyche.

Mouthfeel was very thin with a raspberry-candy like taste on the tongue. THAT was totally unexpected and nearly caused me to gag. OK. I just made a deal with myself - I will drink half of the CAN to give it a fair shake, but the rest of it goes. In fact, I am doing a drainpour right now of everything NOT in my glass at the moment so that I will not even be tempted to finish it. Finish was breathtaking and not in any good way. My chest hurts, I CAN feel the sugar leeching the water out of my brain on my way to a world-class hangover, and my asthma is kicking. Oof. Shame on whomever made this for public sale! 
 
I dislike that I CANducted a drain pour at any point during The CANQuest (tm) & I humbly apologize for having done so. Today is Sa, 26Mai 2018 & I am revisiting this beer in its entirety to put things right. The CANQuest (tm) has a CANmitment to drinking EVERY beer to the dregs/lees/punt/kick & this represents an early failing on my part. It also may NOT have been reviewed to style, but my current policy is NOT to f**k with original, often early, scores. Sorry.  
 
I am SO ashamed of my original that I am going to revisit this beer. My overall impression, given 10+ years of CANflection, is that it is not as horrible as I made it sound. It is as advertised - an American Malt Liquor designed to get you crunked. It is still within the style guidelines, but I don't even want to CANtemplete them. It is like quantifying garbage. ""The maggots lent a piquant flavor ... "". Okay, it's a FANTASTIC AML, but as a beer in general, it SUX balls! Yer the top of the bottom. This is unfit for human CANsumption & any ""To Style vs. To Taste"" reviews should be taken acCANdingly!",1.27
Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,"I recently got a 24oz can of this from my girlfriend- she had noticed my ""malt liquor kick"" as of late and decided to get me some real ghetto fuel, all 10% ABV of it. The can proclaims ""Street Legal"" on the front. The can is interesting, there is artwork depicting a city skyline with a brick wall below it and graffiti depicting the brand and details. Very appropriate considering the target audience for this beer. Here is my impressions: 
 
A- Again the can is interesting, the beer pours a straw yellow. Small head that foams rapidly and disappears just as rapidly. Looks like a budweiser or typical american lager.  
 
S- Smells somewhat ""syrupy"", strong corn odors. Not a favorable sign prior to tasting 
 
T- I can honestly say this stuff is pretty low on my list of the worst things I have tasted. I made a batch of mead last year that went wrong and it came out with a really high (17%) abv- this taste almost just like that with a strong, sweet corn flavor. It literally tastes like it might be a liqueur of some sort. I am not sure it is possible to chug this even with it ice cold. It would be interesting to find out the amount of Carbs per serving of this stuff. After a 1.5oz tasting glass of this I am not sure I can drink the can (damn $1.35 down the drain). 
 
M- Syrupy, do not want to hold it in my mouth any longer than I have to. Leaves a sweet, alcoholic aftertaste 
 
D- Awful, I have a feeling if you could put this down rapidly you might vomit. It probably helps to be drunk already or homeless to handle this stuff in quantity. The ABV puts it on par with wines for serving size of 6oz in one standard drink (as opposed to 8oz for a typical malt liquor) 
 
Conclusion- It might be fun to show off at a party or if you are feeling the need for a quick drunk. Undoubtedly this stuff will cause a nasty hangover in quantity. Open can of this only in case of emergency!!",1.18
Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,"Poured from a 24 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, a bit malty. Taste is yuck. Nothing but alcohol, I would have been better served pouring this into a shot glass. Feels light and yucky in the mouth. I really struggled to finish this can. Overall a poor excuse for a beer.",2.02
Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,"Thrid review tonight , not inebriated yet ... but I will be after this 24 oz... 
 
app.-3.0 Looks average for a malt, nice and light golden , just like a colt 45 or mickey's. 
 
smell-4.0 Sweet sweet malt and hints of alcohol even in the smell. Kind of looked forward to the taste.  
 
taste- 1.5 Malt and alcohol! I cannot even say the alc. is contained well because it's not.  
 
mouthfeel- 3.0 average, medium body , due to the alcohol 
 
drinkability 2.0- I can drink this , but it'll be hard to pretend to enjoy it 
 
If you want to get messed up drink two of these... otherwise steer clear of this malt liquor.",2.44
Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,"Pale golden with a small pure white head that quickly shrinks away. The smell is very solvent like grain alcohol with a sweet caramelized onion smell. This shit is just bad, metallic and way to hot with a sweet vegetal note that makes it unpalatable. This is the worst malt liquor I've ever had, a drain pour.",1.12
Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,"Sent as part of the ""Good Bad and Ugly 08"" BIF. As per the conditions of the BIF, I must review and send an Ugly beer. Here she be! 
 
Dispensed from a 24oz can with a brick wall on the side enblazoned in spray paint graffitti the words ""Four O Street Legal"". Not sure of what street they are referring, but whatever. 
 
Pours a clear straw color with a very nice looking white head. Plenty of lacing and the head actually stays for quite a bit. Nice. 
 
Aroma is corn cob and sweet liquor. Possibly some rice adjunct as well. Not a drop of grains but I wasnt expecting that from a malt liquor. Again, not too bad so far.  
 
Kind of sweet when it first hits the tougue. Then the rice cereals kick in. A little bit of that alcohol gag comes up due to the sharpness and solvency of the alcohol. Kind of an ""old valentine day candy"" sort of taste to it: a bit stale yet sweet and somewhat tolerable.  
 
I have to say, this wasnt as bad as I was expecting. A beer with graffitti on the label cant be that good but this wasnt all that bad. Of course, I served this ice cold and as it warmed, it became less and less drinkable, but I cant say this is the worst beer I have had. 
 
Pretty dry finish and candy alcohol in the finish as well. Overall, sweet and alcoholic. If I was REALLY desperate, I may have this. By all means, spend your money elsewhere.",2.81
Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,"Received as part of a winter holidays gift of malt liquors from a friend who doesn't drink beer and thought this was something I'd like. As hilariously misguided as the gift was, I do appreciate trying something new and something I'd never buy on my own. 
 
Pours a very clear corn husk yellow, with a one-finger white head that sticks around a fair amount, given the alcohol content. Fruity esters, sweet, dominate the nose. Perhaps it's low expectations, but the taste wasn't that bad. Clean and not as buttery as I am used to in my malt liquor travels, but fruity in flavor and slightly buttery in texture, and a very mild carbonation. Body is heavy with sweetness, but not quite cloying. One of the better malt liquors I've had, but not something I want to encounter ever again in my life. Once is more than enough.",1.96
Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,"Well, it's a struggle to know where to begin. Gotta love a can that tags itself. Pours like a beer syrup, with little head that looks ""infected"" (little deposits of bubbles at nucleation sites). Aroma of corn and cider. Hops like they ran past the mashtun with a hop cone at some point in the process. Medicinal and alcoholic. Taste is just as bad. Somehow I think of Duvel: what that is, this is the opposite. No sublety or grace or balance, but oddly enough, no worse to drink than the PBR I had last night: there's something compelling about the big bruising flavor, like a big, dumb drunk that you enjoy listening to at the bar only because he's not picking on you and you're sure he's bound to pass out soon.",1.68
Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,"Purchased a 24 oz. can of Four O at a liquor store in Atlantic City, NJ. The can was left in a hot car for a few hours to warm up the beer and give the aromatics a chance to shine. 
 
Appearance: Pours a nice clear yellow with a solid finger-and-a-half of foam that quickly dissolves away. Many streams of fine bubbles from the bottom of the glass. 
 
Smell: Very corny. A slight bitter element, almost as if some of the metal from the can leeched into the beer. Aroma detected at least two feet away from glass. Not pleasant. 
 
Taste: For a beer with a cartoony graffiti landscape and the words ""Street Legal"" and ""10% ABV"" on the can, it showed a surprising amount of sophistication. There was a very strong corn taste, with the harsh bitterness, but lurking behind everything was a smooth cherry taste, more like Robitussin than maraschino, but cherry nonetheless.  
 
Mouthfeel: The fizz just wouldn't stop. Stuck to my teeth and roof of my mouth. Not pleasant. 
 
Drinkability: I finished the 2-4 of 4-0 quite easily once I got past the first 8 oz. of it. The beer's feel mellowed out once exposed to air. The price wasn't right ($1.55 plus tax) but that notwithstanding this is an adequate malt liquor for, well, Atlantic City.",2.91
Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,40 ounces can courtesy of Unclemattie: Poured a golden color beer with a nice pure white foamy head with good retention and some lacing surprisingly. Aroma of fruity ester with some alcoholic phenols. Taste is not as bad as expected with some subtle adjunct and some fruit ester. The alcohol is really noticeable and I guess can be expected from a 10% malt liquor. Medium body with some good carbonation. This was definitely not as bad as expected but not something I would go for again thought.,2.5

Pours a cloudy gold with a huge white head. Can't fit the 12oz bottle in a pint glass. Excellent retention, bands of lace 
Aromas of green banana, ginger, white pepper, savory herbs, a bit of citrusy coriander. 
Sweet bready malt flavor with an awesome herb and spice component; I get celery, flat-leaf parsley, coriander, ginger, white pepper, and a bit of clove along with some green banana and pear.

Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,"(24 oz can; 24 053; purchased cold from a Casey store in the Dakotas this week... decanted into a Busch shaker pint) 
 
Yellow-amber liquid, very mild haze; luxuriously silky, wavy head; this actually looks fantastic! lace city... smells like industrially artificial sugar cookie with a sweet creamed corn character; maybe a slight sickly corn likker booziness accenting; overall very potent, in your face... on the palate: moonshine and malt syrup - yuck! - I can't even imagine any resemblance to a cheap tripel... luckily, it's relatively dry, almost weightless on the palate, with only the slighest residual film and warmth... as 'unique' as this is, it's far from well brewed, though it has potential; I do suspect this was a lower abv malt liquor cut with grain alcohol or moonshine; something's quite off about it; beware of this! - only drink this ice cold from the can (2175)",3.04
Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,"Poured from a can. Straw in color with a white head. Smells of corn, malt and a sweet hint. Flavors of grain, malt and a boozy bitter background. Not what I would call a great taste but it's not the worst. Worth the try for the dollar I spent.",2.42
Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,"24oz can, date code indecipherable. Poured into an Arcoroc nonic pint glass. 
 
A - Poured a clear golden color with a quickly receding head that left no lacing on the glass. 
 
S - Smells of malts, adjuncts, and green apples. ABV is not hidden well in the nose. 
 
T - Initial tart green apple and corn notes fade to leave a boozy bitterness at the back of the throat. Overall harsh flavor despite the word ""smooth"" being printed almost ten times on the can. 
 
M - Light-bodied with medium carbonation. Feels somewhat slick as it moves around the mouth. 
 
O - Among others within the style, even other HGLs, this one is far from pleasant. Tick completed.",1.79
Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,"Poured from a can into a pint glass 
Appearance – The beer pours a clear golden color with a one finger head of white foam. The head fades very fast leaving just a trace of lace on the sides of the glass. 
Smell – The aroma of the brew is heavy of a corn syrup sweetness mixed with aromas of a dusty dankness as well as a metallic smell. With a touch of cardboard, the aroma is overall not the most enticing. 
Taste – The taste begins with a sweet corn syrup and caramel taste mixed with a touch of grain and a decently strong paper taste. As the taste advances some light mustiness and more paper, as well as some metallic tastes comes to the tongue, leaving one with a metallic and sweet malt liquor taste to linger on the tongue. 
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is light and crisp with a carbonation level that is high. For the style and the more off tastes the feel is good, as it minimizes the impact of the flavors on the tongue to its greatest extent. 
Overall – Not the best malt out there for sure…",2.4
Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,You pussies this is a mans beer,4.94
Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,"24 oz. can: 
 
Pours yellow. Fast carbonation kills the head to bubbles and a ring. No real lacing sticks. 
 
The smell is of alcohol, some grain. Alcohol dominates, but overall not too offensive. 
 
The taste makes my face involuntarily twinges at the taste. This is bad - even for the style. Raw alcohol with an odd sweetness that is tough to describe.  
 
This is harsh - It says ""smooth"", but don't believe it. 
 
This is for people who want a quick buzz at a cheap price. I somehow made it through the whole can, but never again. There are better malt liquors out there. This is one of the worst beers I've ever had. I don't recommend it, even to alcoholics looking for a cheap high abv brew.",1.73
Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,"You know, with so many good beers available, I keep trying these high gravity lagers just for completion's sake. And that's kind of sad. Sure, if you want 24 ounces of 12%, try this or one of the many other high gravity lagers available. Or get something quality with less alcohol and have two. Same result, better taste.

Recently was dared to review a King Cobra. Actually did not know that Malt Liquor was reviewable on Beer Advocate. Once I looked it up and saw I was, had to go with it. Once I saw that there were seven (seven!) (EDIT: now eight (eight!)) other Malt Liquors at the next-door market, made it a point to review one each Tuesday until I run out. Typically am against all the big boy beers, but I am breaking that rule for this challenge. Eighth up was Stack (High Gravity). Apparently it was brewed by United Brands in Lacrosse, Wis., and under special agreement in Memphis, Tenn. Can read “Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager is brewed with the finest extra malted barley and select hops for a bold yet exceptionally smooth taste. Stack 101 Smooth Lager is the first introductory brew style by Stack Brewing Company. Stack beer is brewed with superior ingredients for big, bold and smooth flavor.” A quick look at Beer Advocate and it had it at 2.13. Whoa. That meant it was only better than King Cobra and Old English 800. Going in I had it E40, Mickey’s, Hurricane, Steele Reserve 211, Natty Daddy, Old English 800 and King Cobra with the latter three pretty far back. 
 
Poured a straw clear color with two fingers of off-white fizzy head. Lots of fast moving bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. Decent spotty lacing. Average retention. (Sight - 3.25) 
 
Smelled kind of a mess initially like a bunch of flavors trying to get out of the can. Got red apple, sweet corn syrup, scrambled eggs, skunk, light strawberry, pear and buttered sourdough bread. Not smelling too boozy. (Smell - 2.75) 
 
Usually the first taste of American Malt Liquors for me are not terrible, but the second one can be all over the place (usually much, much worse). However, this may have been the worst first taste of the lot. Second taste was even worse, but not as bad as it could have been. Specifically got sweet corn syrup, buttered white bread, spoiled pear, green apple, white grape, hints of strawberry, boxed white wine, barley, wet grain, scrambled eggs and wet skunky fart. Did not taste 9.9 pct. (Taste - 2.25) 
 
Medium body. Thin texture. Average carbonation. Abrupt finish. Very unbalanced and tough to swallow. (Feel - 1.50) 
 
Was kind of all over the place on a few categories here. Certainly wasn’t a fan. Would have it in the lower 1/3 of the Malt Liquors. (Overall - 2.25)

Faxe Extra Strong,"This is...WHEW! That one word could pretty much sum up the whole experience. I used to praise Euro strong lagers for doing what American malt liquor brands never could, but THIS. I don't know what they were thinking with this. The smell is akin to the most alcohol-forward malt liquors, chemical. The taste retains that cleanliness found in euro strong lagers compared to their American cousins, but it is just TOO MUCH ALCOHOL. I cannot stress this enough. It goes down hot. They were nice enough to add in a seemingly random helping of hops and a touch of sweetness, but none of the rough attempts at balancing I've had in British offerings of the same style. This is just random ingredients mixed together with MAXIMUM ALCOHOL being the only attempt. Making this is itself absurd, importing it to the United States where I am attempting to enjoy it now, is just another level. Why?",1.92
Faxe Extra Strong,"This will knock you back, on smell alone. It has a deepness to it. It does loose it's luster as you go because of how strong it is.

Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),"Poured from a 24oz can 
 
On the pour a finger of acceptable fizzy white head formed on top of a clear deep gold body. After 5 or less minutes, there was zero head retention and it ends up looking like a glass of piss. 
 
Aroma is of stale 6-row covered by a big fruity mistreated yeast ester or phenol thing. Not stinky like some of these HG malt liquors, but not a pleasant lager aroma.  
 
Taste is an improvement on the aroma. At first sip it comes off as a bit bitter from hop extract and too many esters but the more you drink a soft (still stale) graininess comes through for a decently good for HG finish. 
 
Feel is dangerous for the abv. Surprisingly easy drinking and smooth after the initial shock to the system. I can put down a pint of this just as fast as a lower gravity malt liquor or even an MHL. Medium malty finish that is surprisingly pleasant.  
 
Overall this was a bit of a pleasant surprise. After Anhueser Busch's Hurricane I just assumed all HG malt liquors were undrinkable swill, but this one has detectable grain, and vague hop bitterness, making this one of the better I've had.",2.65

Has a head you would expect from a darker beer like this…the head dissipated but still left a thin lingering layer…the lacing is wonderful. The 8.7% ABV is extremely well-hidden in this brew. Honestly—this does leave your tongue longing for more sip after sip, with the melody of flavors. I’m about 2/3 done with this 1 pt 6 oz bottle and I have no idea why I’m already feeling buzzed.

this is so bad its so strong , i couldn't just drink it like a normal beer , i had to sip it like a wine , it took me a while to finish it. 
 
i used to get 4 16 once for $1.99 at the center market and i used to be able to pound them like nothing and that was when it was 12% . 
and after i had to drink this slowly because it was so bad i barly got a buzz . might as well of got a can of pbr...  
 
this stuff is not good , i bought it to see if it was as bad as i remember and the can for the collection. 
 
if you dont want to do either of this stay away , get old englishe ,hurricane, steel reserve, ice house edge or even natty daddy

Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,"I picked up a 24oz can at my local corner mart. Looks like a real winner. ABV is 9.9% per the label. ""Stack High Gravity Smooth Lager."" Reviewed as a malt liquor given its marketing, price point, and ingredients list. Served into a pilsner glass in Austin, Texas. Reviewed live. Expectations are extremely low. 
 
Served cold - straight from the fridge. Side-poured gently as overcarbonation is anticipated. 
 
A: No bubble show forms as it's poured. 
 
Pours a predictable clear translucent yellow littered with abundant carbonation bubbles. It's got some nice vibrance and isn't weak looking like many malt liquors. No floating yeast particles/sediment is visible; it's quite clean. High transparency; you can read text through this beer. 
 
The head is initially two fingers wide but recedes to a very thin layer atop the body inside one minute. Still, the retention is better than you'd expect for a budget range malt liquor at this high an ABV. Some limited spotty inconsistent lacing does cling to the sides of the glass after the head recedes. 
 
Overall, it's an above average appearance for a malt liquor. I can't say I'm looking forward to trying it, but there aren't any egregious flaws.  
 
Sm: Has a heavy malty and adjuncty sweetness. Loads of corn - mainly adjunct. Malt syrups/extract. Not as grainy as would be ideal. I also get some faint berry character - strawberry, I think. It's strange and artificial, but lends some needed complexity to an otherwise boring aroma. To its credit, there are no traces of the 9.9% ABV in the aroma. I also don't find any yeast character - or any really hop character - not even just a simple floral profile. The syrupy sweetness is off-putting, and I'm anticipating a sickly buttery texture, but this is far from the foulest malt liquor aroma I've come across. 
 
Average strength.  
 
T: The syrupy sweetness is certainly the core of the beer, but it isn't as offensive as anticipated. It's got some light graininess and could use more. Heavy corn adjunct is present alongside the aforementioned artificial strawberry note - which isn't doing the flavour profile any favors. I also get a cheap white wine character and some disgusting green apple notes. There's no real hop profile here. 
 
To be fair, I will say that it hides its alcohol content pretty decently. But I can't say I like it; there's no complexity or subtlety here whatsoever. It's far from an intricate or gestalt build. Unbalanced as well. 
 
Mf: Buttery, smooth, wet, and sticky. Overcarbonated as hell. Presence on the palate is abysmal; it's making me a bit ill. Has a bit too much weight, body and thickness for how little flavour there is; it's very filling. The texture doesn't seem well designed for this flavour profile. Execution is quite poor overall, but again I do think it's worth mentioning that it's not a hot or boozy brew, which is something of an accomplishment. That said, it's a pretty harsh mouthfeel overall. 
 
Not astringent or gushed. 
 
Dr: Not the worst malt liquor on the market, but far from the best. It's almost sickening, but I can't give it a lower rating than this because it isn't watery, and still tastes like beer. I'll be making a concerted effort to finish the entire can. It's not a sipper, but its low quality makes it tough to quaff and consuming it is making me feel terrible (especially in my stomach). ABV is hidden better than you'd expect. I wouldn't recommend this beer to anybody. Even just in this style and price range, there are better beers (and more widely available ones, for that matter). Stick to Steel Reserve for those nights when classy just doesn't cut it. 
 
Reasonably atrocious.

Indian Brown Ale,"Innovative, hybrid style part robust porter, part IPA all Brown Ale. 
Deep, chocolate brown with a frothy, pale tan head of sticky foam. 
Aroma is brown sugar and leather, chocolate malted milk and whiff of phenolic esters. 
Flavor is robust for a brown ale and firmly bittered but not IPA IBU's, full of dark and caramel grain character. 
Medium plus body with great balance of sweet and herb bite though a little bit cloying as it warms.  
This reminds me of Ubu Ale and Turbo Dog but bigger and better - with a hint of Kick Ass Brown hopiness.

Taste is of the heralded spice, light clove and banana, some other fruit and a crisp hop bite at the end. It’s similar to Belgian ales but it’s also it’s own thing.

Hennepin,"Procured in a trade/proxy arrangement with @turkeysdrinkbeer in February 2022. Drink in October that year. 
 
L: There are orange cordial vibes going on with the presentation of this beer, making my mouth water before I even contemplate putting my nose into the glass. There's no head bar a small rim around the edges. Sediment from the full-bottle pour hangs suspended in the beer, barely ruffled by the few large bubbles of carbonation that dart to the top of the glass.  
 
S: On the nose, there's a slight yeast note and an indefinable tanginess that hangs in the aroma.  
 
T: The taste has sweet orange, sherbety orange pith and yeast - that orange note probably accounting for the tanginess I picked up on the nose. The orange is followed by a musty, slightly aniseed note. It's probably the coriander and whatever bird-of-paradise grain is. Or perhaps it's the last vestiges of the yeast playing with those spices. Regardless, it's extremely tasty and definitely compels a second mouthful straight after the first.  
 
m: On the tongue, there's almost a sherbety quality to the beer, but it's followed by a spritzy snap after the swallow, and it dries things out quickly after that point. 4.25 
 
O: This beer comes together extremely well. The taste is somewhat unique and the mouthfeel and nose only add to that impression. I wonder if I could drink more than one of these, though, as I can imagine palate fatigue setting in quickly with such a sweet, sherbety beer. It treads this side of the cloyingly sweet line well, but volume could push it over. Based on drinking one rather than several, however, it stands up very well.

Storm King,"Label says best by Oct 22, 2022. Interesting since an imperial stout can get better with age. 
reviews i've read lead me to expect something different in the nose, but the sweet, dark candy smell, betrays nothing about this being any different from any other Impy stout. The opaque blackness topped with a thin, offwhite foam also seem normal. The only deviation is the additional bitterness of the hops, which only appear to me in the taste, rather than in the smell. Its noticably drier than I'd expect, and the alcohol is well hidden. Hops dominate later in the taste.  
Its a nice change, but, to me, a minor flourish rather than a major deviation from the style. The mouthfeel is light, but chewy. Overall, very nice, and at a comfortable price point for an imperial stout.",4.37

There is a very little bit of biscuit malt flavor to go along with it, too.

Man, I love these WC/hazy hybrids when done right. Toppling Goliath, 3F’s come to mind. Some of my favorite breweries out here in SoCal just left some of their coveted WC styles unfiltered, which were tasty in themselves, but not quite the same as this. And Modern Times kind of cut their teeth on the style, but their IPA’s have gotten redundant, imo.  
 
Anyway, this beer is a knockout…crisp and citrusy with a subtly juicy finish. I’d say if you didn’t look at it, you’d guess it’s more of a West Coast style, with that grassy/piney thing going on, but it’s definitely unfiltered and hazy in appearance.",4.46

It was served colder than a wheat pale ale should be, but man did it quench my thirst. The beer had an orangish, wheaty look to it and had similar aromas.

Sculpin - Grapefruit,"12 oz can from Total Wine and More in Short Pump, VA This is a one-of-a-kind ale along with Sculpin. A go-to beer for all times.

The ale has a medium body with average carbonation.",4.04
Sculpin - Grapefruit,"Yet another beer that has been destroyed by being bought out? Pour is deep copper to light amber, much deeper than I recall 'back in the day'. Decent hop notes and some light lacing. This is fresh beer yet offers no grapefruit notes that existed in the past. Taste is a bit malty, subdued, pleasant yet unexciting. Pleasant hop character on the nose yet not stellar, finish is fairly soft for an IPA, lacking the bitterness it is known for. Warming does bring out just a hint of grapefruit though it is fleeting at best. Touch of hop spice on the close. A decent quaff but heading into the 'not worth the calories' realm of once great beers. Who owns this brand now? I don't know and they don't care. Utopia is behind us...",3.03

Dreadnaught,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium to dark coppery amber with a three finger white head with great retention and solid lacing, looks nice. Aroma of biscuit malt, citrus hops, lemon, orange, grapefruit and some dankness. Flavor is biscuit and light dry caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, grapefruit, orange, pine, mild mixed tropical fruit, a little rye; resinous pine and citrus rind finish with great alpha oil bitterness. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. Glad to finally try something from this venerable brewery and I'm glad I started with this. Getting an IPA from the Midwest that has substantial bitterness is a joy in this hazy age and this is one solid IPA. The malt is somewhat old fashioned with good biscuit notes, but the hops are classic NW IPA, which is my favorite profile. Lots going on here and quite enjoyable. This IPA has been off my radar, I'm going to try to snag a Gumball Head next, one of my favorite ale names. Looks, smells and tastes great.",4.42
Dreadnaught,"Pours out of the can a gently hazy deep copper with a nice two finger white head and great retention. Laaaazy bubbles up the side of the glass. Smells piney, resinous, and like ripe citrus. Tastes leans heavier on the pine and resin and hits you a bit with the alcohol. I think on the third sip I was starting to find the malt notes that are advertised on the can. If I'm honest, it's really well done, but the alcohol is a tad bit distracting from the overall flavor, but not enough to bring its score down too bad. It's a robust mouthfeel and is carbonated expertly. Glad I got to try this old school imperial that I've heard was a game changer years ago.",4.35
Dreadnaught,,4.34
Dreadnaught,"From a tap, delivered inside a clear pint glass it came. It's beautifully and brightly copper-amber with a very modest off-white head. The aroma, although not pronounced, brings IPA hops and malt. There's a little too much alcohol to taste to keep it from excellence, but the ABV is 9.4, for goodness sake. The malt body is rich and up to carrying the hops and most of the alcohol. As it should be the hops, both citrusy and earthy, dominate the outstanding taste.",4.43

Dreadnaught,"16oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for $4.89. Canned on 3/17/23, so this is five weeks and a day old. 
 
Look: It pours out a very nice light orange amber color with very tiny floaties. The two fingers of rocky, beige-colored head slowly dissipated. Looks like a nice Imperial IPA. 
 
Smell: It smells super piney along with a bit of citrus notes. I get orange peel and some pepper. There's also some sweet malt notes and some boozy bubble gum notes. For a beer that is this big, the nose is underwhelming. 
 
Taste: This is a huge Imperial IPA. At 9.4% ABV, it really does not taste nearly as strong as it is. It's dangerously drinkable and it's actually somewhat balanced. Up front, it's malty and sweet for a very short time before the hop bitterness takes over. The finish is very bitter and earthy with huge pine notes and grapefruit peel and it lingers super long. Eventually, orange peel and caramel/crystal notes come forward after the bitter hop resins fade from the front of the palate. After pouring the bottom of the can, the body improved a bit but the taste also became slightly chalkier. 
 
Feel: It's medium plus bodied with a nice chewy, slick, and slightly oily mouthfeel. 
 
Overall: This is definitely a solid Imperial IPA. I can appreciate this beer, but it's not really my personal preference to go seeking this out again. I may have had it many years ago via Beer Trade, but at that time I was just looking to seek out the ""big beers"" that were highly rated and I may not have even had an Imperial IPA before, so it was worth trying again.

Smell: Strong notes of citrus fruits - orange in particular. Strong hoppy aromas as well. Very dank but also has a sweetness to it as well that makes for a really pleasant smell. 
 
Taste: Powerful hoppy front, nice bitterness that you’d expect and it really bites down on you. Citrus fruits follow - I’m getting the orange from the nose plus lemon, malts, some barley, and then there’s a really nice bitterness after the baseline taste finishes. All in all it has a very imperial taste to it, and it’s superb.

Taste is a tad confusing; it’s not this big hoppy dank bomb I was expecting / hoping for. The sweetness is annoying. There’s a hint of bitterness trying to surface but the sweet kicks it back down.

Delirium Tremens,"11.2 oz bottle acclimated to 56°F and poured into a goblet. 
 
Pours a rich amber/honey gold with a long lasting 1 finger foamy white head, leaving a think ring of lacing. 
 
Initial aroma is clean fruit esters (my brain is saying pear and pineapple but it's very faint and I'm not sure) with a somewhat sterile, clear alcohol smell. Additionally a pepperiness, a light, fresh, light green grassiness, and a light white floral note can be found. Maybe damp hay? I guess that's probably the yeast. After agitating I notice the alcohol comes forward, and a clean and pale maltiness can be found. 
 
Initially before swallowing I get a peppery tingling, may be due to the alcohol, there's also a sweet, vague fruitiness. 
 
After swallowing I'm hit with alcohol upfront, stays at the back corners of the roof and bottom of the mouth and top of the front half and tip of the tongue and reminds me of a fruity brandy, I'm getting specifically pear. I get a malty note I can best describe as damp hay, just like I smelled. The pepperiness I smelled is there too, it seems almost paired up with a dry, somewhat bitter grassiness which differs from the grassiness I smelled. A note of dry white wine reveals itself to me upon getting further in and is now present throughout the whole process. The aftertaste comprises dryness, alcohol burn (which fades), fruity fumes, and that dry white wine taste. 
 
Feel is very smooth, with almost a chew to it. Fuller body than average, genuinely almost a little syrupy. Additionally, the carbonation persists, meaning that I can truly enjoy this one slowly, which is how I drink beer. 
 
Overall it excels. The flavors pair with each other exceedingly well and it exhibits a top display of coherence in beer. The only thing I can think of that I would prefer is a lower ABV, I generally quite enjoy high (and quite high) ABV beers but the alcohol burn in this one is reminiscent of a brandy or other spirit and it's harsh to my tastes. Still, this beer could be renamed delirium tremendous. 
 
Will absolutely buy again at some point, though not often. That's on me though, I love love love Belgian dark ales, but Belgian pales are not my absolute favorite. Otherwise it would be a common purchase. Will be recommending to people for sure.",4.03

Aroma: Strong aromas of Belgian bread spice, cloves, yeast, and bread malts. Faint citrus and flower underneath. (4.00) 
 
Flavor: Strong flavors of Belgian bread spice, flower, yeast upfront. It then evolves and shows the alcohol for only a bit before a rich, smooth, and sweet bread malt comes through with some sweet citrus and alcohol warmth to back it up. Finish is smooth, bready, and sweet. (4.00)

Expedition Stout,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this one yet. Had at least 10 bottles of this over the past few years. Bottled 9/14/21. Just about two years old. A perfect aging.  
 
The pour yields a thin line of dark brown foam. It quickly fades, leaving a ring around the glass.  
 
Nose is right down the middle Russian Imperial material. Roasted malt brings notes of dark chocolate, dark fruits, brown sugar, and the slightest bit of soy sauce. You can tell that this brew will be incredibly animated just from a first glance.  
 
Taste follows through, but bringing even more. Roasted malt, smokiness, dark chocolate, dark fruit, slight caramel, brown sugar or perhaps even black strap molasses. Wonderful stuff. The bitterness on this one is just perfect. Reaching high points, but never overwhelming or obtrusive. The flavors still fly true, almost urged onward by the bitterness, them working in tandem. Everything working together to create the final product. 
 
Mouthfeel is fullbodied, almost pillowy. Has heft and density to it with just the slightest bit of cloying. Very mild carbonation. The mouthfeel delivers the flavor perfectly.  
 
Overall this is easily one of the best Russian Imperials you can buy. In eternal cellared stout, beer fridge, staple material along the likes of Sierra Nevada's Barrel Aged Narwhal, Old Rasputin, and Founders Imperial Stout. A brew that demands respect.",4.59

Sculpin - Grapefruit,"12oz can purchased off the shelf as part of a mix-a-six pack for $2. PKG 07APR22, so this is almost four months old. 
 
Look: Pours a very pretty copper color. Almost completely clear; just a very faint haze that appeared after I poured the bottom of the can. There was a thick, rocky off-white head that slowly reduced to a very thin layer. 
 
Smell: I definitely smell the grapefruit aroma up front. It smells nice. Other fruity, caramelly, and herbal/vegetal notes but nothing distinctive besides grapefruit. After delving into it, I can detect nice apricot and orange zest aromas. 
 
Taste: It's very tasty. Up front, there's grapefruit flavor with a bit of acidity. The mild, gentle initial grapefruit flavor explodes into an oily, bitter, pithy profile that attacks the sides of the tongue and the back of the palate. The finish is long, piney, resinous, and bitter with lots of grapefruit peel and pith. Eventually, I can detect a pleasant caramel malt sweetness after the bitterness subsides. Even though this beer is so bitter, I feel like there is an element of balance to it because along there's also a lot of caramel malt to help counteract the strong bitterness. 
 
Feel: Medium bodied with an appropriate level of carbonation. Someone oil, slightly chewy mouthfeel. 
 
Overall: This has got to be one of the quintessential West Coast IPAs. I tried regular Sculpin IPA many years ago, and I was utterly unprepared for how bitter it was. This is also very bitter, and I think that my palate has adjusted over the years and now embraces bitterness. This beer requires a palate adjustment for many folks, and that's okay because many folks' palates (and minds) need to be adjusted! It's also nice to see that this beer can hold up to Father Time; at almost four months old, it's still very aromatic and flavorful.

Several were taken down during the first few weeks of the covid lockdowns as there really wasn’t much else to do other than try new beer. We never put the beer into words. From memory though, Steam was a fantastic sipping beverage with its profile defining bitter hoppy bite. The history and tradition, you could taste it. A real shame to hear earlier this week about the full closing of the brewery. The Christmas ale was a staple of the holidays for the past number of year. A very sad day. Pour one out for Fritz.",3.64

Smell: very clean, simple, malty bread aroma. Not much going on but that’s not always a bad thing.

Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),I actually like it alot. I am no conisiour but it is very good,5
Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),"12 oz can poured straight from the fridge into a pilsner glass  
 
Pours a clear yellow gold with a quickly dissipating, 1 finger, sudsy white head, leaving behind minimal lacing and a film of head. 
 
Initial aroma is cereal grainy, bready malt, crisp, and yeasty. It's the classic lager smell, a little in the way of fruity yeasty esters. After agitating I'm hit with a blast of yeast, not quite funk but something in the vein of yogurt bacteria, there's also a high amount of malt. 
 
Initial taste before swallowing is malty sweet, almost fruity. After swallowing I'm met with a large dose of grain and malt flavors, a little tasteless but the taste that is there is good. Relatively high sweetness throughout the whole process. 
 
Mouthfeel is honestly better than I would expect from a 4.8%. it's not spectacular but it's not really thin either. Carbonation is overall mediocre but definitely adds a lot, it fades quickly but rejuvenates impressively upon agitating. 
 
Overall I totally understand why this is revered as a good cheap beer. Like, listen. It's not a great beer, but it's already not bad, and for $1 a can it becomes better. I realize that's not the healthiest way to measure the worth of something, especially alcohol, but I'm not buying in large amounts. It excels for the adjunct lager style, while being inoffensive and extremely easy to drink, if nothing else. 
 
Definitely will purchase again at some point in the future, likely in 6 pack format, and will recommend as a good cheap beer. Will not purchase often, but still.",3.65
Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),"16oz can. Date stamp on can bottom is 'OCT2323', for best by consumption. 
Clear, pale gold colored body. Thin white, small bubble head. This head is constantly replenished by rising bubbles. Left behind are some scattered spots of lacing. 
Aroma of grain and corn malts, very doughy. Has a little floral and earthy hops. 
Taste is malt laden - grain and corn, which is slightly sweet. Floral and fruity hops. Quick end to the aftertaste. Touch of sulfur. 
Slightly thin for mouth feel, but this might have something to do with the rapid exit of flavors after each sip or quaff. Smooth and crisp finish. Very good carbonation. 
Wet and simple profile. Poundable. Does not get in the way of bar activities.",3.16
Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),"Light clear golden color. Great for hot weather, when you're eating and don't want anything to distract from the flavor, or when you're doing something that you're not thinking about the beer itself like watching sports. Definitely not a craft beer, nothing exciting or interesting about it, but it is not bad for what it is which is a cheap macrobrew. Think of it as a palate cleanser when you get tired of all the high flavor microbrews and then you'll be fine with it.",2.84

Pours black as night into my Guinness glass. A little amber-copper visible right around the edges. 3-inch head that dissolved in minutes to a thin layer.  
 
Smells fruity, sweet and alcohol.  
 
Taste: I don’t usually drink beers > 7%. So take this for what it is. I’m not tasting much beyond the alcohol. Some coffee roast lingers in the aftertaste. Not getting much sweetness until the aftertaste. It’s getting more complex as it warms up, but still it’s just stronger alcohol than I enjoy.  
 
Feels decent. Not too watery. Not too heavy. Lightly carbonated. Overall good feel.

Nose is nicely rich, roast, powdered chocolate, light coffee; all present pretty evenly, a light fruit skin like twang to it. 
 
Taste is so bold yet so drinkable; light dark chocolate with a bite of slightly over-roasted coffee, light sweetness, with a nice ever so slightly piney finish, chocolate lingers in the form of cocoa powder and light roast. 
 
Mouthfeel again, like the rest of this beer, bold at first, but just for an instant; quickly becomes incredibly drinkable and almost light; there is nice little bit of hop bite on a finish that is remarkably dry. Much like the nose hinted at, it has a twang on the finish, light light fruit skin like acidity.",4.34

Double Trouble,"355 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 9.4%, 86 IBUs. Surprisingly pale golden colour, probably the palest American double IPA I’ve seen. Big to moderate white head. Distinct but still relatively moderate aroma of citrussy and piney American hops, also notes of caramel and orange marmalade. The flavour is of course very hoppy from start to finish, but not really extreme. The grapefruity bitterness is partly balanced by a pronounced malty sweetness.

Feel: rich, silky, velvety, and smooth. Low carbonation as expected given the style and the 13% abv. Warmth from the alcohol during and after swallow. Tingling spice on the tongue (from the chile peppers) long after the swallow.

Bomb!,"From a 12oz bottle, dated 03/17/22. Served in a tulip. 
 
Pours a slightly thick-appearing chestnut-black with a finger of dense mocha foam. The head holds up for thirty seconds or so - actually pretty good considering the abv - leaving a scant collar and a barely rousable spattering of super-slippery lacing. 
 
Nose is rich and chocolatey. Aromas of milk chocolate and chilis.  
 
Taste is candy bar-like, mildly sweet, nutty and lightly roasted. Sweetened coffee taste is present but dominated by Lindt-type milk chocolate at the beginning, then by ancho chili and vanilla on the back end. Tasting demerara sugar, mocha java, ancho chili and vanilla. There’s a subtle nutty, peanut buttery character at the end and into the aftertaste. 
 
Feel is smooth and creamy, not much more than medium bodied I think, but further lightened by the ample, fine carbonation. It’s a notably clean mouthfeel considering the style, the abv, and the various adjuncts. 
 
Overall, nice. Clean-drinking and tasty, only lightly sweet and not at all syrupy. At least comparable to many of the finer imperial stouts I’ve met but perhaps at a more regrettably unattractive relative price point.",4.22

T: Ohhh wow, Definitely an AMAZING beer!! Huge spicy chili chocolate up front followed by a easy vanilla ride to the coffee profile in the after taste. Man oh man this one is top 5 in the books. 
F: Spicy, acidic, heavy bodied beer - not to carbonated. Easy to drink, can't taste the alcohol at all. 
O: This reminds me of a similar imperial stout made with spices that resemble chili peppers. This for me is a barrel aged version of Ducato Verdi Imperial Stout but with different characteristics that make it much more complex such as a spicy bakers chocolate upfront taste followed by a smooth vanilla ride to the end where the coffee after taste lingers.

It tastes very interesting. The wood, sweetness and boozy flavor from the 10 abv remind me of whiskey... not bourbon because there's no smoke. After the whiskey you get bright hops and bitterness. 
 
The mouthfeel is very light with just a little fizz. It finishes with an aftertaste of bitterness with breathy alcohol. 
 
Overall it's very good. I wouldn't describe it as an IPA. It's a beer I can't really categorize. I give it a 4.9 out of 6. I think it would have received over a 5 if it hadn't come right after that insanely good stout.",3.94

Dogfish was way ahead of the curve in oak-aging a beer like this. Warming caramel and hop notes, with the alcohol well-hidden (as it should be).

Here we go, beer number 666. And a 101oz bottle at that. I paid over $100 for this but I think it’s gonna be worth it splitting this thing with my boy. Let’s unlock the mini padlock and pop this baby open! 
 
Pours murky reddish brown with 2 fingers of tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing 
 
This has definitely lost its' intense hoppiness over time, but this honestly smells great now, like a lightly hoppy barleywine. I'm picking up on aromas of sweet brown sugar, molasses, toasted pecan, earthy hops, caramel, golden raisin, and light toast 
 
Where it was charmingly old in aroma, this is a bit too old and faded in taste. It's not necessarily bad but it's showing significant age. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting earthy hops, fusel alcohol, caramel malt, and light fig. The swallow brings notes of brown sugar, toasted pecan, brown bread, and nutty malt 
 
A medium full body pairs with very mild carbonation, resulting in a smooth yet slightly hot beer. Finishes mostly dry with a mild earthy bitterness 
 
It's not the best beer in the world, but I'm still happy to have gotten this big bottle. I'll have to see how I feel after finishing the big ass bottle",4.21

Alpha King,"From my review in NBW 138: 
 
Hello all! Let's get this new beer weekend started, shall we? 
 
This one is Three Floyds Alpha King, sent to me by the inestimable @TurkeysDrinkBeer many moons ago, and one that has been begging me to drink it for some time now... 
 
So, onto the review! 
 
.... 
 
 
This beer has sat in my fridge for six months. It came to me, pride beating in simmering waves from its aluminium chest, across the continental USA, leaping the Pacific Ocean and docking, prouder than John Holmes in a ruler factory, at the back of my fridge. 
 
Since that time it has mocked me. Dared me to drink, to partake of its malty, dank body. But I have been iron of will and clear of mind. Other beers have begged attention, required consumption or perched, testily, at the edge of my fridge. This one has waited, and I have been strong. 
 
Today, though. Today is dawned, bright, clear and autumnal. The air is crisper than it should be. Autumn has slid sneakily to my house, bringing weather not yet welcome for months. It is cool, but I wear shorts in stubborn refusal to bow to sensibility. It makes me angry. I am stubborn, and I am steadfast. But as afternoon breaks I am wroth, and this beer is front and centre. 
 
Angrily I pour. This beer has mocked me, but now I call the shots. In response, it flares its fluffy white warning clouds at me. Unperturbed I sit and wait, still and at one with time. 'Ere long it subsides. Meekly, it exposes its dark, caramel-amber coat, easel to its thin, off-white head. Moderate carbonation follows but, King of my liquid domain, I barely acknowledge the elemental offering of carbon and oxygen. No ritual obeisance will slake my thirst. [L: 4.25] 
 
I offer my nose as the beer, unbowed by curt dismissal of its visual defences, throws rich, chewy caramel notes at me. I rebuff the scent, but It follows with a volley of umami-laced, soy background notes. I pause. Hark, my nasal messenger, do I detect the glory of the titanic pale ales of my spotted craft beer youth? My first stumble, the first scintilla of doubt. Does this bear the ghosts of the pale ales of yesteryear? If so, can I stand before its glory? [S: 4.25] 
 
I regain my chest-forward, arrogant composure. The taste will not mirror the nose. Without a doubt, a tropical, umbrella-bedecked fruit tingle lies in ambush beneath the olfactory assault I have endured. Beer of 2023 can not follow malty talk with commensurate walk. But I am mistaken: taste mirrors the nose, with rich, tangy, chewy caramel and toffee. In backup are deep umami malt notes that envision unearthed deep soil and the bugs that huddle within. It follows with moderate, danky retronasal bitterness sitting at the back of my tongue, building and building before turning back into a long, tangy, caramel finish. This is no tropical fruit bomb! I am bereft of defence to this sorcerous beer! I twist and turn, refusing to partake, but am trapped in this beer's embrace! And it knows it. It knows, Lord it knows. I must take more. I am slave to this delicious throwback to malty pale ale goodness. [T: 4.5] 
 
It refuses to let up. It throws a smooth and full mouthfeel at me, as though nought but an afterthought. It waves away my loving embrace of its carbonation, previously dismissed like so much unwanted chaff. This beer knows better, and it knows how to play its cards. It is harmony, yet it has broken mine. [M: 4.25] 
 
This beer has sat in my fridge for six months, watching, waiting. It pounced when I, suffused with arrogance, sought to bring it to its barley-kissed knees. Instead, it reminded me of the power of malty, hoppy goodness. Reminded me that a whole history of beer lies unloved, forgotten in our lust for tropical, sour and pastry highs, discarded as soon as the next sacrifice kneels at the block. This beer has held its own after an improbable journey to my fridge and then beaten my senses back into shape as it taught me a lesson I should not have needed to learn, and will study for time to come. [O: 4.5] 
 
Cheers!

Nice sugary chocolate smell. Bit of burnt wood.  
 
Some malty sweetness on the front which builds to a mixture of toasty flavors and even a bit of nuttiness. Quite smooth and complexity of flavors grow as it warms. Alcohol is present and there is burnt flavor, maybe like a burnt marshmallow, that lingers. The beer never strays to far from its porter base.

Saint Lamvinus,"This was drank almost a week ago, at Vítor Claro's home - the winemaker from Portalegre, behind the Dominó and Claro & Ferreira brands. 
 
Trying to review this from the top of my mind. 
 
Poured from the bottle to a stemmed wine glass. 
 
A: The body is dark purple with a light purple, almost pinkish head. Created a generous foam quantity that lasted quite a while before jumping in. 
S: The aroma is actually perfect without any overpowering acidity. It's balanced as it is sweet, savory, and acidic to the right point. It's a great beer only by smelling it. 
T: It's the taste of heaven. I think that after Fou'Foune, this might be my favorite Cantillon beer. It's perfectly balanced with the sweet notes from the grain and the grapes embracing quite well the light fruitiness, and very light bitterness of aged hops combined with just the right amount of acidity incoming from Brettanomyces. It's really great with nothing to point to as a downside. 
M: Body has just the right feel, being light with the cool effervescence and silky tones from the sweetness you can find in this beer. Bitterness is low. Acidity is mild. 
O: As said before, this ranks at the top of my favorite beers. Unbelievably good.",5

Great red counterpoint to Vigneronne. Huge barnyard funk in the aromas with a bit of red wine coming through in the back. Tart, tannic, and winey in the flavors. Maybe a bit vinegar-y, but that's how it is with Cantillon. Basically the liquid equivalent of farmhouse cheese 
 
86/100",4.3
Saint Lamvinus,"(~5 oz tiny snifter draft pour at Monk's for Zwanze Day 2022... review copied from scant notes taken on my phone) 
 
band aid, plum powder, malty, lipsmacky, fuller bodied 
 
what I can add from memory: for me, this is the one from that first flight that had the most personality, and I think my drinking buddy would agree, he being a luster of red wine... I believe this beer poured near brilliantly clear, making its reddish-purple hue more vibrant and alluring, mwahaha... its slight phenolic note definitely hits first and firm, while its fruity flavors take a few moments to surface... the 'plum' flavor for me wasn't so much fresh fruit as it was a ghostly concentrate essence of floral fruity aromatics, lingering in the background... would love to try it again from a bottle (2039)",4.22
Saint Lamvinus,"Pours a rich, deep purple, brief pink head that settles to a thin ring, light lacing. Taste is tart fruit up front, balanced by a mild, noble hop character (mushroom, earth, grass); lots of lingering oak barrel character as well. Feel is crisp and clean. A very good expression of both grape and barrel without letting these elements overwhelm.",4.24
Saint Lamvinus,"On tap at Armsby Abbey 
 
Welp, I inadvertently ended up here for Zwanze Day! I was at a show right down the road at Palladium and figured I’d come here after, only to find some true whales of mine. It’s finally time to see what their grape Lambic is all about 
 
Pours a clear reddish purple with a finger of light pink head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing 
 
It’s quite soft in the nose, but there’s still the requisite funk. I’m picking up on aromas of red wine vinegar, lemon juice, wheat bread, wet hay, stone, and sharp oak 
 
There’s more bite to it in taste, but conversely less grape. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting wildflower honey, lemon juice, straw, apple skin, red grape, light toasted oak, and a hint of cherry. The swallow brings notes of lemon zest, wet hay, sharp oak, red wine vinegar, crabapple, light blueberry, and pear skin 
 
A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a sharp beer. Finishes bone dry and tart 
 
Damn, this is awesome stuff. Not quite on par with Fou Foune, but it’s always nice to try Cantillon",4.39

Edmund Fitzgerald,"Pours out of the bottle a deep brown color with a finger of head and mild retention. Smells like cocoa, roasted malts, and coffee. Tastes slightly bitter to begin but then gets taken by the dry chocolate flavor. Nice inoffensive carbonation that provides a nice robust mouthfeel. Really nice.",4.21
Edmund Fitzgerald,"One of the best beers I have ever had. Such a great look, the feel is so smooth and easy to drink. The taste is bitter like black coffee but makes sure you feel great drinking it. It is a VERY good beer",4.76
Edmund Fitzgerald,"Pours from a bottle into a Guinness glass dark brown-black, like Coca-cola. Tan head, maybe an inch, dissolves but doesn’t disappear. (Like a relationship that goes on after the thrill is gone.) 
 
I can’t smell much (bad air in the 513). Floral-y with some alcohol smell.  
 
Tastes GOOD. Dark. Bitter like dark and burnt and broodingly regretful, like the remnants of my broken heart, or real (black dark-dark-roast) coffee. Has an aftertaste like Coke, only without the acid. As it warms up, just some hints of caramely-sweet in the aftertaste that aren’t there in front. The sweet stays on my lips. (“If she only…” says my broken heart.) 
 
Feels lighter than it looks. A little carbonated. Drinks fast and easy. I was done with it before I wanted to be. (“Tell me about it,” says my broken heart.) 
 
Overall: a very very good beer. VERY good. Like, my own personal standard for what a dark beer not called Guinness can be.",4.53
Edmund Fitzgerald,"Color: almost black with a thick and creamy head 
Smell: dark chocolate and coffee are predominant with some malt and toffee sweetness underneath 
Taste: bitter coco and coffee, malt and a tiny bit of sweet peeking through  
Feel: holds up well with good texture and mouthfeel  
Highly drinkable, would recommend",4.26
Edmund Fitzgerald,,4.43
Edmund Fitzgerald,Excellent beer. Very dark. I love it. Recommend trying it. I found this at Earth Fare got a six pack for $6.99. Has lots of head to it. Definitely can taste the malt and hops in it. Much better than any of those light beers I’ve had.,4.79
Edmund Fitzgerald,,4.61
Edmund Fitzgerald,,4.45
Edmund Fitzgerald,"Pours a clear black/brown with glints of red. On top is a foamy tan head with good lacing. Notes of caramel, brown sugar, chocolate, coffee and herbal hops round out the nose. The flavor is smooth and rich for a brew that is surprisingly light on the palate. Hop flavor and bitterness is subdued and the malt really shines with warm caramel and chocolate flavors. Medium bodied with a crisp finish. Overall, I guess I am a little taken aback as I always thought this was more of a big, robust porter from hearing about it. In reality it is a much more quaffable, session-able take on the style than I always thought. Much like great lake's lagers, the level and complexity of the beers malt flavor is much more than one would typically find. This is a very refined, drinkable, and delicious dark beer. Definitely deserving of being compared to Deschutes Black Butte, Sierra Nevada Porter, and other classics.",4.5

Punkin Ale,When I smell a beer this delicious and warming I expect to look at a stout. There's some cloudiness but the nose backs it up. I pick up mostly a dry hop flavour. Maybe that's a characteristic of pumpkins that I am not aware of. I was Leary of the beer cos I don't like too many added flavors. But it did everything but disappoint.,4.96

Punkin Ale,"Consumed on: 23 Nov, 2022 
Glass: Chalice 
ABV: 7% ABV 
Serving Temp: 51.6 F 
 
 
Look:  
Dark orange-tinted copper. Thin off-white fizzy head quickly dissipated to a thin ring-and-islands pattern. Lacing is OK. 
 
Smell:  
Some light (very light) pumpkin aromas but mostly spices. Strong spices. Cinnamon dominates along with ginger and some cloves as well. There is a sugary sweetness underlying these other aromas. 
 
Taste:  
Follows the nose. The sweetness takes on notes of Candi-sugar and really balances out the spice notes. The ginger becomes the dominate spice in the flavor. The pumpkin is far in the background here. Nutmeg can be detected in the aftertaste. 
 
Feel:  
Crisp but also a tad syrupy. The body is medium-light, if that. 
 
Overall:  
I am not a big fan of pumpkin beers, but this is one that I don't mind. Perhaps because the pumpkin flavor and aroma is quite muted. Since I don't drink many pumpkin beers, the spices really do jump out at me.",3.66
Punkin Ale,to me this is basically the perfect beer,5

Miami Madness,"Cloudy orangey yellow body, white head. Smells and tastes exactly as expected but even more potent and balanced: absolutely huge guava, passion fruit and mango with cutting wheat and salt, backed by lemon, cracker and lactose. But here is the thing, I came in expecting this to be underwhelming, but the intensity and depth of the fruit flavor, then met with contrasting berliner backbone is impressive. Feel reflects with tart juice up front, dry and snappy wheat on the back end, lingering light sweet and salty textures is appreciated, though this is certainly a new world take",4.45

Edmund Fitzgerald,"Updated with review in March, 2023. 
 
Format and age: 12oz bottle gifted, best by April 22, 2023. 
 
Cold chain: somewhat unknown. Transported cold after receiving it and kept in fridge at home. 
 
Impressions: pours very dark brown with red edges and a one-finger tan head. Aromas of chocolate and roast coffee dominate. The taste starts with a big kick of bitter chocolate that sweetens as it lingers in the mouth. Progresses to notes of dark roast coffee and burnt toast with some dark fruit on the finish and aftertaste. As it warms, the dark fruits come out more while the bitter and burnt characteristics recede a bit. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, resulting in a smooth feel. 
 
Overall: a great porter. Great Lakes did a good job keeping the bitterness in check while retaining that quintessential porter profile and making it more thab just a roast bomb. Definitely my favorite since having Everett quite a few years ago now.",4.23

This is really fantastic, but so is regular benthic (2021), specifically and especially when fresh. Lots of coconut, but not in the pastry territory of something like Coconut Vibes. Coffee is still present, but balanced by the coconut. Mouthfeel is on point.  
 
I tried to rate this for what it is, not whether or not I felt a little let down - which I did. I had expectations that it would be a little more coconut forward. In fact, I'm not sure it is truly that much different than regular benthic, but that doesn't make it any less delicious. It just didn't quite meet the expectation I set for it.",4.74

Black Tuesday,,4.6
Black Tuesday,"Finally gotten my hands on a Black Tuesday. 2021 Version. 18.9% ABV 
 
Pours out a very dark brown liquid with some translucence during the travel from the bottle to the glass. No foam whatsoever. No surprise there. There is a creamy appearance to it though. Like chocolate milk towards the center with more light penetration on the outer edges.  
 
Nose is straight up strong bourbon and oak against a huge roasted malt backdrop. Ethanol is defintely showing itself. Chocolate is prevalent here as well. Sweet confection, like a rich caramel, interacts with the chocolate and brightens it up.  
 
On the palate, we've got that huge bourbon for sure. Oak tannins are strong on this one. That chocolate shows up but gets overshadowed by both barrel influence and roasted malt. Some savory notes permeate this brew. This aspect always reminds me of well done street cart pretzels. On the back end there is a beautiful dark chocolate covered coffee bean note that lingers for quite some time.  
 
Mouthfeel brings heat not only from the ABV but the tannins as well. Hot and drying. Probably would be better off drinking this in the dead of winter, but alas, here I am in the dog days of summer.  
 
Overall, while I very much enjoyed this brew, the time its taken me to snag this bottle combined with the ever rising prices of, well everything, this one didn't quite live up to the reputation placed upon it.

Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing opaque black in the glass with a fizzy, one finger light khaki head that quickly dissipates to sparse patches with slight lacing. Aroma of dark toasted malt, bourbon, dry caramel, chocolate; boozy. Flavor is bourbon, dark toasted malt, bakers chocolate, raisins, dry caramel, oaky vanilla and a touch of licorice. Hot boozy bourbon finish. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess and sharp carbonation. I've tried a lot of bourbon barrel stouts in my day, and this is the most bourbon forward that I can remember; almost like a bourbon boilermaker that was extra heavy on the whiskey. Fortunately, there is a lot of flavor in the base too, with good chocolate and oak, some dark fruit and caramel that are more reminiscent of a blended strong ale. I was concerned with the fizzy pour, but despite the quick fade of the head, there is plenty of carbonation. There is a lot of intense flavor at the start of the taste, but the bourbon alcohol kicks in and dominates the finish; nice oak and bourbon in the lingering finish. The two years this can has on it has not seemed to mellow the flavor much (and if it has, glad I got an aged one). I expected a big, boozy stout and this delivered. It is a bit on the unbalanced side from the barrel effect, but enjoyable. I'm glad about the sensible 16oz. can over the traditional The Bruery 750s. Glad I had a chance to taste this classic.",4.3

Black Tuesday,"Poured at 54°. Black body with some ruby see-through and good clarity; light brown rocky head dissolved quickly leaving no cap retention, ring nor lace; thick legs sheet the glass on swirl. Nose is bourbon and black licorice; boozy hot retro nasal; molasses as beer warms. Bourbon and bittersweet dark chocolate entry; oaky vanilla; molasses middle; hot phenolic finish. Hot mouth warmth from 18.9% abv; alcohol bite on tip and sides of tongue; full, non adjuncty body; silky feel, light carbonation; barrel dry finish. Overall, you better like boozy (and I do); layers of base and barrel flavors which are well balanced all but for the alcohol which is hot; dry oaky linger; definitely a beer to be enjoyed one sip at a time.",4.47

Seen these on shelves for $50 dollars and it honestly just tastes like Deths Tar just a bit thinner and a bit less sweety but more boozy even after 8+years . 
Poured out very light brown( i expected a darker and thicker pour for obvious reasons)and settles dark brown into glass. No head whatsoever. A lil bit of bubbles swimmin up like salmon . 
 
Tastes is dark chocolate, caramel , big dark fruit and heavily roasted malts with a harsh boozy finish. Nothing special. 
Way too boozy as well. I feel the burn in my stomach from each sip and it gotten bit overwhelming after 4 sips. 
Mouthfeel is too thin for the high abv in my opinion. 
 
Always wanted to try this one and very happy I did. To whoever sent me this one a million thanks cuz Much happier i didn't get suckered in to paying what those bastards are asking for these bottles . 
 
I'm not afan of The Bruery mainly cuz of the prices they charge( i get it gotta pay for barrel storage)and weird ass beers they make , but may buy one So Happens It's Tuesday once a year in pint can . 
 
Overall I can see why no ones gives a fuck about these guys anymore. This is nothing special compared to a lot of stuff on shelves now and tastes way too hot even after 8 years. Makes sense why most members of their beerclub have 750s spoiling in their cellars cuz this is hard to finish and can't imagine getting through half the bottle alone. 
 
Update : still have 1/3rd of the bottle in my fridge 3 days later cuz i didn't wanna drink anymore.  
The price they charge for these is a crime.  
 
Pro Tip: If you been wondering about this and don't wanna buy cuz of the price tag just buy a bottle of bourbon ... you'll be better off",3.53
Black Tuesday,"Sampled at Cigar City Brewing’s El Catador Club XV bottle share party. 
2021 vint. 750 ml bottle. 
Poured a hit into a logoed Cigar City taster’s glass. Little spritz of head doesn’t last at all.  
Smell is bourbon heavy chocolate, vanilla bean pod, prunes, vapor of alcohol. 
Taste threw me back a step with a full assault of molasses, creme de cacao, dark malt, coffee and oak barrel.,. then the 19% ABV let me know who the boss is. 
Feel is mighty mighty and thick. Tounge tar. Rich as Musk. Low carb.

Black Note Stout,"Recording my review from memory. I drank this last night but wasn't able to write it up. 
 
12oz bottle, my friend drank half and gifted the rest of the bottle for me. He had suggested that we drink it together but our schedules didn't match up and he wanted to crack it open. No bottling date. This is the 2017 vintage, so this beer is probably 5 1/2 to 6 years old! 
 
Look: Pours a very dark brown, almost black color with impressive carbonation for a six-year-old bourbon barrel-aged stout. There was a thin brownish-colored head that reduced to a wispy layer. The head regenerates temporarily after swirling the glass. 
 
Smell: Up front, the aromas on this beer (at least at this age) are all umami, all the time. It has that rich, interesting soy sauce note that is blended with dark chocolate and subtle dried fruit aromas. Secondary notes of vanilla and amaretto. 
 
Taste: I am really impressed that this beer has aged so well. I was expecting it to be dull and flat. But it is really smooth, rich, very flavorful. It's also really drinkable and there is basically no heat on the palate. The umami flavor is really nice and then the beer has a nice dark chocolate richness. The beer has subtle sweetness, and the finish is mildly bitter with nice roasted malt character. The amaretto note is also really nice. 
 
Feel: It's not thin and it's not especially thick either. It's somewhere in the middle, I would say that it is medium plus bodied. The mouthfeel is nice with soft carbonation. 
 
Overall: It's very tasty and really enjoyable. I've never had this before. It would be nice to get a fresh batch of this beer and enjoy one every year to see how it develops over time.",4.25

Black Note Stout,"1829 
Name: Black Note Stout 
Brewery: Bell's 
Location: Comstock, MI  
Style: Barrel-Aged Imperial Stout 
Date: 10/05/2017 
This beer has been on my wants for a long time, but I thought I would never get the chance to try it. I was sent this in a box by a fellow beer friend. Using a tulip glass, I served the beer at 52 degrees. The pour created a one in half finger length head with dismal retention. No lacing was left on the glass after the quick dissipation. Charting the color of the beer somewhere around SRM 34, dark brown, nearly black. The appearance is slightly above average, regardless of the head retention.  
Nosing the glass, I detected bourbon, oak, espresso, dark chocolate, cream, oats, raisins, molasses, caramel, toasted bread, dark roasted malts, a hint of char, and a notion of floral.  
Sipping the beer, I taste bourbon, oranges, oak, resin, molasses, milk chocolate, dark coffee, raisins, caramel, toffee, toasted bread crust, oats, a tinge of soy sauce, a hint of Maillard, and a little smoky char.  
The mouthfeel is thick and coated. The body is a medium plus, has low carbonation, and has a delicious finish.  
This beer held up beautifully. I am pleased to have the opportunity to quaff on this stout. Thank you kindly for allowing to have this chance to try a retired beer. Simply a fantastic beer!",4.46
Black Note Stout,"2016 vintage 
 
Another BIF beer from @Eziel, and they only retired beer of the lot. This one was quite the highly regarded beer in its time, peaking at roughly #78 overall based on data from the wayback machine. Let's see if it can hold up to the barrel aged Stouts of today 
 
Pours an opaque medium brown with a finger of dark tan head that fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing 
 
Man this packs a boozy punch in the nose for a relatively low 11.2%. I'm picking up on aromas of sweet bourbon, black cherry, plum, cocoa pwoder, fruity coffee, toasted oak, light tobacco, and vanilla 
 
It's a bit less fruity and more malt-focused in taste, but still just as good. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting black cherry, cocoa powder, caramel, brown sugar, toasted oak, sweet bourbon, vanilla, and lightly burnt coffee. The swallow brings notes of hot bourbon, burnt coffee, charred oak, cocoa powder, raisin, sweet vanilla, toasted hazelnut, and caramel 
 
A full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation from the booze, resulting in a rich beer. Finishes surprisingly dry, roasty and balanced by sweeter notes for a shockingly drinkable Stout 
 
Damn, I liked this one more than I had expected to. Even at 6 years old, this is really good. It's too bad they retired this one",4.37
Black Note Stout,"12oz bottle into a goblet. 2016 release, so 5 years old. 
 
Looks superb in the glass. Jet black body. Generous tan head shrinks to a ring and faint covering, impressive given the abv, and leaves streaks and spots of lacing. 
 
Aroma is wonderfully boozy with a lot of dried dark fruit. 
 
On tasting, so smooth. Boozy, nicely warms the back of the throat. The dried fruit notes add a hint of sweetness.  
 
The mouth is a bit thinner than you might think, but it still rolls around the tongue beautifully. Finish is a warming smooth booziness, with a faint sweet note. 
 
Overall, delightful sipper of a beer. Been after this one for a while, so thanks to the mighty Sabatinis in Exeter PA for releasing a case from the cellar.",4.44

Mexican Brunch,"Taking brunch south of the boarder, Kane Brewing looks to chili peppers, cinnamon and cocoa to give a decidedly Mexican twist to their imperial milk porter. 
 
Mexican Brunch kicks off with a very dark brown pour and a frothy cap that fades rather quickly. As a scent of coffee rises first, a quick followup of syrup, chocolate, nuttiness and spice ensure a complex and enticing scent. Fully malted and sweet on the tongue, high impressions of chocolate, caramel, maple, toffee and vanilla play out in hot chocolate fashion in its early impressions. 
 
As the flavors start to unfold, the middle palate holds onto its milky sweetness while the strong taste of coffee sets an earthy, nutty and roasty tone. Cinnamon and chilies mingle next for a sense of balance for the sweetness and to complement the coffee spice. Woodsy, earthy and toasty, the beer trails into a kahlua-like finish with balance and contrast in taste. 
 
Full bodied and soothing on the finish, the beer finishes both spicy and calmly with the milk sugars and maple rounding out the gradual simmer of peppers into a warming afterglow of a Mexican inspired, alcoholic cappuccino.",4.24

This monster pours a dark brownish black with a moderate head of light brown  
foam that settles to a thick ring that dissipates to a thin ring with no lacing....but 
give it a swirl and this one has some nice legs! Bourbon, oak, vanilla, dark roasted 
goodness, dark bakers chocolate, dark coffee, raisins, and astringent booze notes.  
Flavors nail it! Dark bakers chocolate in bathed in rich bourbon, vanilla, oak, rich 
char, dark berry notes of blackberry and raspberry, brewers licorice, and dark bread.  
Excellent mouth feel for such a beast-----smooth, rich, coating, full body, light  
carbonation with subtle lift, and a warming, bourbon forward, bitter roasted 
malt finish that is medium dry.

This is really quite good. I'm a coconut fiend, and this doesn't disappoint It's essentially liquid dessert - milk chocolate coconut. To me, it's sweet but not diabetic sweet. It's less sweet than Coconut Vibes (Shared, aka side project), but it's also less coconut forward. Coconut vibes is also liquid milk chocoluate coconut, but it has a noticeable coconut pop. This is so integrated that the coconut is integrated, but not popping. I'd prefer the popping, but this is way easier to drink than that.

Sunday Brunch,"Appearance: Sunday Brunch pours a deep, dark brown color with a thick, creamy head that dissipates slowly.  
 
Aroma: The aroma is rich and complex, with strong notes of coffee, dark chocolate, and a hint of vanilla. There are also hints of toasted oak and a slight smokiness. 
 
Taste: The flavor is bold and intense, with a strong coffee profile and a noticeable alcohol warmth. The dark chocolate and vanilla flavors are present as well, with a slight sweetness that balances the bitterness from the coffee. There is a slight smokiness in the aftertaste that lingers on the palate. 
 
Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is silky smooth, with a creamy texture that coats the tongue. The beer is medium-bodied and has a medium carbonation level, making it easy to drink. 
 
Overall Impressions: Kane Brewing Sunday Brunch is a complex and flavorful beer that is perfect for sipping on a lazy Sunday morning. The coffee, chocolate, and vanilla flavors combine perfectly to create a decadent and satisfying experience. The alcohol warmth is noticeable but not overpowering, making it a great choice for those who enjoy a bit of a kick with their morning coffee. The smoky finish is a nice touch, adding an unexpected depth to the flavor profile. Overall, this is a top-notch imperial porter that is well worth trying.",4.59

Orange-honey color, I'd call it highly hazy or cloudy in appearance, but not truly opaque like some NEIPAs. Thick, creamy looking head, colored somewhere between off-white and beige. Lots of lace and sticky globs of foam adhered to the sides of my teku as said head dropped. 
 
Aroma is reminiscent of tropical fruits, melons, stonefruits and grapefruit. Big hoppy nose to this, in a way that straddles the NEIPA and WCIPA styles. Curious to see if the beer's hoppiness is as dramatic in the taste. 
 
Up front, it's actually a little less intense than I was expecting. It's definitely a fruit forward beer in terms of the flavor hitting the taste bud beachhead, but it's a bit more restrained. At the finish it is sharply bitter, almost grassy and quite dry. This sharp dryness seemed to mellow as it warmed a little after opening. 
 
Soft, slightly creamy mouth feel. 
 
I'm not sure this is my new favorite hazy, but it'd be in the conversation and I'd hit it regularly if it were local to me. Thanks for this, Andrew!",4.29

Medianoche - Coconut,"This one pours a fairly flat looking inky and gloopy looking black color, with no head or lacing. 
 
This smells like pure sugar, cheap melted chocolate milkshake, coconut syrup, and caramel. 
 
This is actually disgusting. This series used to be some of the best barrel aged stouts in the country, but Weldwerks has just gone off the deep end with these. It’s just tastes like sweet stout glue, basically – it’s basically liquified black sugar – it’s basically…you get it, right? It’s just way too sweet and cloying, with barely any barrel. There’s not even that much coconut, it’s just way too sweet of a base – just loads of cheap overbearing chocolate character. 
 
This is too thick, and not drinkable at all, with very little carbonation. There’s not much booziness, but that’s maybe the only single kind of good thing I can say about this.

Flavor – 4.5 – Follows the nose. Begins and ends citrusy and full-bodied, a bit dank and resinous over caramel malt. No yeast or ethanol. Barely noticeable gastric warming. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Ends crisp and dry with a little resin. 
Palate – 4.25 – Full; dry; lively carbonation. 
Final impression and summation: 4.5 Good DIPA – dank, crisp, and citrusy.",4.46

Keene Idea,"Not sure why people feel the need to write reviews along the lines of ""it's an old style not fit for today's trends"".......it was brewed to be a piney, bitter, and malty beer and it's damn well crafted. If you were into trendy scotch drinks and were handed a glass of Louis XIII Cognac, would you poo-poo it for being different? Old school west coast IPA's exist for a reason, and they have certain qualities that make them different from the trendier new england style. This beer is a fantastic brew, with pine and malt flavors bursting onto the scene in a way you just don't find with most beers made elsewhere. When you take a sip, you just know it is a well crafted, and balanced brew.",4.44
Keene Idea,"No. No, no, no. I can't understand how everyone takes this well-balanced yet boring double IPA and elevates it to a godly status. It's fine, but the flavors, scent, and mouthfeel stop there. As a California born dude, I above all want to champion our beers. This is fine, but it's just not the champ.",3.75
Keene Idea,,4.25
Keene Idea,"Many reviews talk about the perfect balance between malt and hops displayed by this beer. They're not wrong. This beer has seen the tightrope strung across the canyon of drinkability and confidently trod the cord, using malt and hops as its balance beam while declining to use any of the 2020s' juiciness for a safety net.  
 
Make no mistake, this is a bitter beer. It demands an experienced drinker's palate, but rewards the garnered experience of a craft beer drinker with a beer that displays subtle citrus notes, a strong yet not overbearing malt backbone and a hoppy, piney, resinous kick that unashamedly proclaims its double IPA genes.  
 
In reality, this is an anachronism in 2022. It recalls the IBU wars of 15 years ago, but remains relevant because, at the end of the day, it's a damn good beer

Pours a pure golden yellow that's mostly clear, but I wouldn't describe as crisp. The colour, actually, isn't far off from a slightly lighter version of the label. Wet bubbles rise through the liquid, but there's no head, and thus nothing to retain nor leave lacing.  
 
Nose is bright and inviting. Starts off much more on the fruity side rather than the truly funky side (we're getting there, though, don't worry!) with some apple, and like meyer lemon. The apple transitions to a mustiness that gives rise to thoughts of wood, and carries us over to the earthier funkier side with light elements of barnyard and just a kind of tart element.  
 
Flavour is awash with an interesting lead in that I want to give credit again to that meyer lemon-type flavour, then bits of crabapple and wood giving way to the earthy funk again, which presents in a really interesting way that I can only think to describe as, 'open.' I don't know how that works, but where a lot of funky wild ales like this feel tight, compressed, bound up tartness, this feels like the pages spread wide and a more easygoing (but no less pronounced) welcoming earthy funk. The lemon and the funk kind of build together to a pinnacle about 2/3 of the way through that is more in the horse blanket realm and borders on harsh, though the rest of it feels aggressively tart, but in a welcoming manner. The back end takes elements from all of the above, along with a little bit of bleu cheese and faint honey to leave a tart dry finish.  
 
Very fine carbonation sits atop a decidedly funky/tart beer, but one that I wouldn't describe as sharp.  
 
I've had several in the -ation series, and they've all been top notch. This is no exception. Thanks, Tim for sending this along my direction!!",4.17
Beatification,"Bottled 4/3/20. Poured at 52°. Deep gold with excellent clarity; thin tight white head, poor cap retention leaves a small island of micro dots; brief thin ring, no lace. Mild funk, apples and oak nose. Tart green apple, pear; mild funky horse blanket; white grapes middle; oak; mild tart fruit on backend. Light body; moderate minus carbonation; crisp dry finish. Overall, the funk is mild; drinks like a lambic style minus the barnyard intensity; very approachable…a perfect gate-way beer for those not familiar with Belgian Lambics who want to dive in.",4.68
Beatification,"Had this on draft at a place with one of the early RRBC accounts in my area. It brought me back to my first pilgrimage to RRBC in Santa Rosa at the 4th Street location. I thought I was there for the IPAs but a family member ran into someone they knew with a goblet of another RRBC barrel-aged product who said ""I don't even like beer but I love this!"" I ordered my own goblets and was introduced to the loveliness of Sanctification and Consecration. 
 
So began my love affair with RRBC barrel-aged stuff. The 100th percentile score is well-earned. This is a delicious sour, which offers common ground to people who normally will not drink sours. The more sophisticated reviews for this will fill in all the notes of stonefruit and granny smith apple stuff that my review lacks; all I have to say is, in the same way that you could serve PtE to someone who would never touch a DIPA with a ten-foot pole, a goblet of this can evangelize regular folks with unsophisticated palates like mine to appreciate the wonder of wild ales and sours made by skilled people.",4.79

Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"2018 vintage; consumed on 5/22/2023 
 
Pours a jet-mahogany body topped with two fingers of fluffy, khaki-hued foam; good head retention leaves a spotty, paper-thin cap, large, creamy collar, and a modest array of chunky, webby lacing strewn around the walls of the glass. 
 
Aromas open to fresh prune laden with prickly oak as accents of fig wash through an encroaching bourbon undercurrent sporting progressive dark cocoa and edgy vanillins detailing. 
 
Taste brings saucy prune and stewed dates upfront, with notes of dusty cocoa and charry oak encroaching on Werthers Originals past the mid-palate into smoked toffee meeting distant undertones of burnt vanilla on the back end of the profile. 
 
Mouthfeel offers a medium-light body and a robust fluff of moderate carbonation, dispersing an airy char to a steadily cleaning roast washing over the mid-palate, a quiet warmth trailing into a bright twang integrating effortlessly toward the finish. 
 
A daring fusion of barrel and brightness in a profile saturated with near-syrupy dark fruit reductions and a tempering, deft level of cocoa char; an exceedingly bold, almost authoritative expression of the style executed with adept clarity.",4.46

Location: Warren MI 
Style: Old Ale 
ABV: 13.5% 
Date: 2022 
Next on the review desk is Fourth Dementia from Kuhnhenn Brewing. I am going to start to pull some big ones from the cellar. This beer has been on my want list for over eight years. Many beers on my want list, like Fox Farms, require travel. I am excited to get to this review. Using a tulip, I served this beer at around 50 degrees. The pour created an airy, fingered light brown head with no retention. It came and went faster than life. No lacing was left on the glass. The high alcohol content could cause the head to wane. I was charting the color somewhere around SRM 32, dark rusty brown. The appearance is about average for this style.  
Nosing the glass, I smell whiskey, oak, caramel, toffee, chocolate, soy sauce, mild coffee, bread, raisins, smokiness, Maillard, vanilla, char, and tobacco.  
The first sip is like a perfectly executed tango on my palate with flavor. I taste whiskey, oak, caramel, toffee, chocolate, soy sauce, mild coffee, bready, raisins, figs, vanilla, Maillard, tobacco, char, dark roasted malts, burnt sugar, and an aged wine note.  
The mouthfeel is slightly warm and coating, finishing smooth and long.  
This beer is smacking. The wait was worth it; everything about this beer is terrific. The barrel age is near perfect. The warmer the beer gets, the more flavors develop, creating this symphony in your mouth. Stellar beer; I wish I had several more to sip on.",4.67

I knew downloading Tavour would be a good idea, and I am very grateful that it allows me to access this long time want of mine. I’ve only had one other Kuhnhenn beer before, the best in style Raspberry Eisbock that I enjoyed very much. This one is yet another highly regarded style topper. Let’s dig in 
 
Pours an opaque dark brown with a finger of creamy tan head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing 
 
Wow, this is huge in the nose. Super malty and bourbon forward. I’m picking up on aromas of brown bread, toasted walnut, sweet bourbon, dates, smooth oak, sticky caramel, raisin, brown sugar, smoky tobacco, light aged hops, and sweet red wine 
 
It doesn’t reach the same levels of intensity in taste, but it is still very good. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting brown sugar, dark bread, raisin, black cherry, sweet bourbon, caramel, smooth oak, light vanilla, and old leather. The swallow brings notes of brown bread, molasses, toasted walnut, brown sugar, sweet bourbon, burnt caramel, toasted oak, port wine, smoky tobacco, and light sherry 
 
A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer. Finishes off dry with just a touch of booze, feeling well before 13.5% 
 
This is absolutely awesome! I’m so happy I finally got the chance to try it, and even happier I have 3 more bottles of this to drink",4.57

Big pineapple aroma with tropical Starburst, dank jungle weed and mango beneath. 
 
Pineapple-forward taste as well, coupled with an interesting herbal note that lends some slight bitterness in the finish. There was fairly strong Playdoh in there at first, too; it might have been connected to the head, because it faded after the first few sips. 
 
Full bodied with fairly zippy carbonation.

I was surprised to see that Trillium did a Xmas drop in the Chicagoland area of fresh hazy beers, so I grabbed some as soon as I could for my holiday week. I find that when someone can do a lower abv (6.6%) with a lot of flavor that that is more an achievement than knocking out a DIPA. My pallet generally goes toward liking the higher abvs, but I need the lower one once in awhile when having more than one beer in a sitting. I am loving the balance in bitterness here more than anything. The Midwest brewers love to land on the sweeter side, but I actually like the dryer bitter finishes more. The beer does lack quite a bit on the nose as I am not getting much beyond some citrusy hop notes buried deep. The feel is full and smooth. Overall a great beer. I wish I had a fresh Zombie Dust to compare to see which would win for me.",4.47

Citra,"Both @2beerdogs and @Beersnake1 sent me cans of this one related to the recent NBS BIF#16, so I guess the California contingent feels strongly that I should try it!! 
 
Beautiful clear caramel gold colour with a good finger plus of just off white foam. Soft and velvety with sprinkled large bubbles, it sticks to the glass as it recedes.  
 
Nose is a great showcase for citra hops, and that works for me, because citra is a great hop! There's some citrus, some pine, some kind of light honeysuckle and wonderful rich complementary caramel malts underneath.  
 
Flavour isn't quite as rich as the aroma, but it presents all the goodies. Bitter citrus and pine, some caramel malts, some round fruits... finish is bitter but not overpowering by any means. It's mostly in the pith/citrus side of things, but not the full on acid bomb of like a Monkish, and it's balanced with a little bit of earthy pine and a touch of the sweet malts to balance.

The Rusty Nail,"Poured from 22oz waxed bomber into a tulip. This is the 2023 vintage release; this version is 14.1%. I had this beer ages ago when it first came out, but I'm just getting around to reviewing it now! 
 
Appearance: dark as a moonless night with a starless sky. Impenetrable. Head is a thin layer of tan foam; that could be a little nicer. 
 
Smell: cinnamon right up front, but with enough vanilla from the bourbon and a dash of licorice to really give the feeling of a sweet bread. I mean, this thing is as sweet as summer days are long, but the overall vibe is ""great big hug from a panadería"" and I am very much into it 
 
Taste: sweet, of course, but with a very bakery-like sensibility, as in the aroma. The licorice and alcohol give the otherwise sweet cinnamon-roll flavor a more mature dimension. I really love the complexity of flavor and juxtaposition of elements here. It's diabetes in a bottle, but hey, I don't really need these feet! 
 
Mouthfeel: rich body with a good carbonation and a smooth, satisfying creaminess. Maybe not perfectly silky, but damn fine. 
 
Overall: the drinkability for a 14.1% BA stout is truly astounding. This beer is a sugar bomb; I'm really going to have some explaining to do after my next A1C evaluation. However, that doesn't mean this beer isn't goo-ooo-ood.",4.46
The Rusty Nail,"Yet another time to be alive pour, this one also came during the tap takeover for BeerNV right before the Alabama show at Lake Tahoe. This was the 2022 version.  
 
Pours black. Even though its the same color as a stout, I expected greater viscosity. Didn't amass much of a head. Some brown cherry cola like head but it was thin, 1/6"". Blew a hole down the middle. The aroma didn't yield much in the way of roasted malt, it put a much heavier influence on the barrel(s). Sweet bourbon and/or whiskey notes dominate.  
 
The taste gets a little more complex, perhaps its the stuff I loathe like licorice or cinnamon bark, actually making a yield that is more enjoyable than the sum of its parts. The mouth feel isn't hot or bitter like I was expecting, its a real smooth showcase for a pretty big beer, but it doesn't have that challenging edge that extreme advocate seems to desire.

The nose features the barrel and a wee bit of malty char. Pleasant but unremarkable. 
 
The taste reveals the licorice and cinnamon bark. They pair nicely and do not dominate as I feared. I'm wary of cinnamon in beer, but the deft hand of the brewers keeps things in harmony. 
 
Mouthfeel is luxurious and finish is barrel. Not too hot but the booze is felt. There’s enough carbonation to satisfy.",4.28

Cocoa, molasses, cinnamon, baked oatmeal, sugar (demerara with hints of muscovado), tobacco, vanilla, and coconut in the nose. Sweet, complex, and balanced.  
 
The flavor follows the nose but is joined by a wave of chocolate covered cherries, plum torte, cloves, faint poblano, sweet hay, and more. Malty and rich with hints of toasted nuts and 'smores in addition to black licorice and cinnamon. Medium earthy finish with the base beer shining through like the best oatmeal cookie you've had. Hints of ceylon tea at times. Low bitterness throughout. Flavors are not quite integrated - curious how this would age. 
 
Slick, oily, full-bodied mouthfeel, low tannins, and lush carbonation. Well hidden ABV.

Oh man, we have quite the big boy here. A 21% on a Tuesday afternoon? What the hell am I doing? Well, I’m on vacation this week and today turned out to be a stormy day, so I figured it’s the perfect time to crack this beer I received in a BIF from the legendary @Eziel. I’m getting close to the end of what he sent me, and they’re all heavy hitters. Let’s see what this one is all about 
 
Pours a very dark brown with a finger of light beige head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing 
 
There’s a definite sweetness in the nose, but it’s wonderfully balanced given its size. I’m picking up on aromas of chocolate fudge, earthy bourbon, toasted oak, nougat, black cherry, sweet caramel, molasses, toasted hazelnut, and light vanilla 
 
This one really packs a punch in taste, heavy booze and char fight for attention while a huge sweetness backs it all up. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting charred oak, cacao, sweet bourbon, red grape, marshmallow, sweet vanilla, molasses, toffee, light nutty malt, and black cherry. The swallow brings notes of hot bourbon, charred oak, nougat, cacao, black cherry, molasses, apple brandy, vanilla, sweet caramel, and nougat 
 
A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a silky and slightly thick beer. Finishes mostly dry but boozy as all hell 
 
There’s no 2 ways about it; this beer is incredible. So complex and hitting all the right notes. Perfect for a quiet day to myself hanging out outside while it rains",4.52

Black Tuesday - Reserve,"2021 batch. Most of the BT Reserve years is two sets of bourbon barrels, but this one is grape brandy and then bourbon. 
 
This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and no lacing. 
 
This smells like charred oak, lots of bourbon, lots of vinous grape character, brandy, roasted malt, dark fruit. 
 
This is a nice bridge between some of overtly wine based Black Tuesday variants, and the regular bourbon Black Tuesday. The grape brandy adds a pleasantly oaky vinous character, sweet, but finishes dry, with oaky char, marshmallow, dark chocolate, caramel, roast, and bourbon. 
 
This is medium bodied, slightly thin as most Black Tuesday variants tend to be, with a lots of concentrated booziness. It’s not overwhelmingly boozy, but it really kind of does drink like a distilled stout liqueur. 
 
I haven’t had much Bruery in a while, but this was definitely a fun beer to revisit this brewery with. It’s definitely something to share with a bunch of people, like 10 people, maybe, but it’s well done.",4.22

Served in a Black Tuesday chalice, the beer pours dark brown/black with not quite an inch tan head that fizzled away somewhat quickly. I like the aroma a lot, the brew smells like dark fruit, brandy, bourbon, vanilla, molasses, dark chocolate and roasted malt. I like the taste a lot too, it's similar to the aroma but with the addition of some dark bread, burnt/charred malt, coffee, licorice and earthy flavors. There's a lot going on here, but all of the flavors mesh well together with no one flavor overpowering the others. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's coating and a bit syrupy with a moderate amount of carbonation. Nowhere near as boozy as I was expecting considering how strong this brew is!

Taste is slightly sweet from the grain malts. Sulfur note later in the profile. Wet cardboard malt in the aftertaste. 
Thin mouth feel, and not much else except for the fizziness. Okay carbonation.

as a side note, the last time i tasted this, i was a minor, about 10 or 11 yrs old 
i have tried beer since i was a toddler, only little sips and all, mostly Dixie, and this one

On the pour about a finger of head that quickly recedes to a thin cap. Body is light straw yellow. High carbonation. 
 
Aroma is very dry, but there is a slight skunky sulfur note that isn't very pleasant. Hops are present but they add to the smell in a strange skunk boosting way. Like a lower quality Mexican lager. Maybe some light alcohol is on the nose. 
 
Taste loses a lot of the hop character except for right up front with a slightly spicy or zezty and herbal but cheap hop note. Immediately malt and corn character build in a crackery and popcorny way while maintaining a dryness. 
 
Feel is surprisingly full bodied, with a slight dryness, but medium long grainy moutcoating finish.

Sip Of Sunshine,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass 
Appearance – The beer pours a clear golden amber color with a one finger head of white foam. The head has a decent level of retention, fading over time and leaving a moderate sum of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. 
Smell – The aroma is very strong of a sweet grapefruit and tangerine smell mixed with notes of papaya and some herb. There is also a rather strong peach and apricot smell, mixed with some lighter smells of pear and biscuit malt. 
Taste – The taste begins with a nice smooth tangerine and bready malt flavor mixed with the grapefruit hop that was in the nose. There is a touch of herbal and pine hop at the start as well, but these are very light in comparison to the grapefruit hop flavor. Other flavors of a light honeydew melon and a decent showing of mango and papaya are there as well, with the ladder fruit getting more intense as the taste advances. A light floral hop and a bit of grain develop at the very end, leaving one with a smooth and rather citrus strong taste to linger on the tongue. 
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is on the lighter and thinner side for a 8 % abv brew, with a moderate carbonation. For the big citrus and fruit flavors the feel is quite nice, making for a nice and dangerously easy sipper. 
Overall – A very pleasant drinking, citrus forward, and highly flavorful IPA. A quite well crafted and very tasty brew.",4.51

Sip Of Sunshine,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium to dark coppery amber with a three finger off-white head with good retention and nice lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus and tropical fruit hops, orange, pineapple and mixed tropical fruit and a little pine. Flavor is lightly caramel malt, citrus, tropical fruit an piney hops, grapefruit and orange rind, pine needles, mild mixed tropical fruit and some dankness. A somewhat different piney and citrus rind flavor develops in the finish with great aggressive bitterness. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. I guess with the market domination of hazy NE style IPAs out here in the West, I kinda thought the East Coast would be a wasteland of hazies. I've been lucky enough to get several fine IPAs from out East and I'm now convinced that good old non-hazies are available there too. This is a fine example. Not quite a West Coast profile, but lots of the citrus and pine I crave. Lots of herbal hop flavor. I am especially happy about the flavor change about mid-taste, where strong pine takes over from the citrus and fruit, but a somewhat different, mixed fruit note is revealed behind the almost resinous pine. Appropriately named,this is a bright, cheerful IPA I'd love to drink again.",4.4

The Peach,"Never giving up on those childhood snacks de Garde takes the influence of fruit rollup and rolls it into a winey, earthy, tart and spicy wild ale. With lambic influences at the helm at well, this fruit rollup is corked, capped and ready for adulthood. 
 
Pale gold and lightly of chrome, the light and yeasty haze of The Peach teems with bubbles while building a loose necklace of foam. Pulling from its white wine appearance, the session kicks of with a plume of stone fruit over a citrusy, tangy, earthy, briney perfume chocked full of both funk and fauna. As its mild mannered sweetness greets the tongue, the suggestions of communion wafer, sourdough and a hint of tafffy gives a soft and wheaten buffer to start. 
 
As the malt sweetness bounces effortlessly from the palate, the tastebuds soon carry the brunt of acidity that pangs away with lemon, lime, white grape, crabapple, yuzu and passionfruit with a stronger acidic twinge. All the while, the peach character gives a melon-like roundness for a smooth stone fruit taste. Nearly apricot, mango and orange-like, the bright and ripe peach flavor is radiant. Trending peppery with dry oak and lightly bittered hops, hints of grapefruit, grape seed and a mossy earthiness provide an earthy and peppery exit from the palate. 
 
Light, crisp and highly refreshing, the off-clean ale finishes briskly acidic with a series of short sourdough echoes laced with peppery white wine, saddle leather and oak tannin.",4.34

Pours clear, light golden, with a small ghost of a head that disappears and leaves a tiny ring around the glass. Smell is tart and funky. A bit of wood, some dry chardonnay. Something musty. Very interesting. 
 
Taste is dry, tart, very chardonnay buttery, peach / stonefruit notes are there but kind of drowned out by the woody / chardonnay notes. Tartness is somewhere between unripe peaches and lemons. Mustiness is some combination of the butter and wood notes I think. 
 
Mouthfeel is medium to light, super dry, slight filminess, gives a sense of liveliness that might just be prickly acidity. Overall, it's good and very interesting.",4

Big peach nose, big barnyard funk, lesser so horse blanket funk, oak more than the cognac support but both there, slight floral notes too. Tart and somewhat earthy peach starts the taste before the dry and sharp funk massages the oak and light cognac into the peach, apricot, lemon, green apple all support, but finish doesn't elevate, rather it goes somewhat acidic with a hint of balsamic vinegar. Feel is bright, sour, decently acidic cumulatively, and funky, almost feel more vinous on the finish. Very nice peach wild ale. The 6th best?

Supplication,Bottled in 2014 poured into a tulip glass. This beer has way too much going on. Almost like they tried to creat so many flavor profiles it ended up just tasting like a mess. Not very drinkable thus not very enjoyable.,2.4
Supplication,"Bottled 7/2/17 and received courtesy of @dimidiata. Fairly clear, amber color coming out of the bottle, settling to a deeper semi-translucent caramel once in the glass. The aroma initially struck me as typical wild brett funk, but upon closer inspection the cherry and wine barrel notes revealed themselves in a pleasantly discreet way.  
 
Taste is wonderfully........different. This is unlike any beer I can recall in recent memory. The cherries are remarkably present after 5 years, but the wine barrel combined with the earthy funk is what's really making this one interesting. Plenty of sweet malts up front, but then the funk emerges mid-palate and into the aftertaste. Fairly full bodied and lightly carbonated.

I saw 30 packs of Natty and Genessee for $24. High Life was $26. Something called Boxer Premium Lager was $19.99 for a 36 case! That is 55 cents a can, in 2022!! I though.. Jeez that will probably be God awful and likely poisonous. So I checked beeradvocate, and it got some decent reviews. I said I'll give it a try. If it's awful I only have 35 more",2.57

Boxer Lager,"Not to objective because it is my favorite lager and costs less than a buck for 24 ounces.  
 
It has a cara-pils malt taste that harkens to the beers they made at that brewery since I started drinking. Some comments attribute it to yeast...which makes some sense because you couldn't afford expensive malt at that price. 
 
Most younger ""serious"" beer drinkers are sucking down heavy hopped beers. If your looking for your beer to taste like high gravity bitters or grapefruit you will need to spend more money. 
 
This beer is distinctive and produced in relatively tiny batches. At the price there is no comparison.  
 
It reminds me a bit of beer from India.",5
Boxer Lager,"This is what happens when Millennial beer-snob, know-it-alls review a beer. 
 
If this beer were twice as expensive and packaged differently, with maybe the silhouette of Muhammad Ali, or a sharp photograph of a boxing glove, the 30-somethings would be falling all over themselves.  
 
As it is, this is a cheap, easily drinkable beer with a wonderful mouthfeel and a nutmeg, Hefeweizen taste. 
 
Not my first choice. But an OK choice. 
 
Is it a 'BudHead?' *( the tantalizing, wonderful, heavenly mix of two great North American loggers, Moosehead and Budweiser mixed in a 50/50 proportion? ) HELLS NO.  
 
NOTHING IS. 
 
( and if you're NOT thinking of going to the store and buying a sixer of each, both Moosehead and Budweiser, and trying it yourself in a tall dimpled or nonic glass, then you are simply a fool )

Boxer Lager,"Poured from 12-ounce can into a vintage O'Doul's bow-tie glass. Stunningly clear golden color, with a finger or two of white head that settles rather rapidly. As AAL's go, this is pretty inoffensive. Boxer is light bodied, not too sweet, and mostly dry on the finish, with some light grain, grassy hops, and hints of tart apple on the nose and palate. Pretty typical. However, there is something else going on here: there are unmistakable notes of hefeweizen yeast, which contribute aromas and flavors of banana and clove. These notes are present in some other offerings from Minhas / Rhinelander as well. Is this a characteristic of their house yeast? I don't know. But those notes of banana and clove really give this a pleasant kick. (And you can't beat the price!)",3.61

First time I had this was at a billiards/ping pong kinda arcade bar on the second floor (my first mistake) in New Orleans like 5 years ago. It was piss then and I didn’t even really drink beer at the time. Now it’s plan undrinkable to me an frankly I love the regular Heineken. It’s a great lager with good crisp taste. This? This is flat, pungent skunk water. It’s Heineken but it’s like been run through the drink dispenser hose at the bar.

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's clear but not as clear as I thought it would be, I can't see my finger prints through the glass, nor are my fingers really that clear. Odd. The initial finger-thick head of bright white that rose up over the fairly deep golden body is now already gone but there are some splashes of lacing left behind. The aroma is sweetish and dare I say malty? It's not grainy, and it's clear that there's some adjunct in use, but there is some maltiness to it. There's also, unfortunately, some esters that I connect with higher fermentation... not good. The flavor follows, and again, it's surprisingly malty, and sweetish like wort. I don't detect any specific oxidation like a papery characteristic, but it could be that some initial oxidation is making it seem more malty. Just a theory. It's medium bodied and crisp. I didn't find any hops in the aroma, nor do I find any in the flavor except for a touch of an herbal and leafy note in the finish. It's background though and that higher alcohol ester thing is still there and distracting. This is obviously not well made, but it's cheap - although there are many better made budget beers on the market that cost less. Disappointing.

Boxer Lager,"Poured from 24 oz. can into a pint glass 
 
Appearance – The beer pours a very nice golden amber color with tons of tiny bubbles streaming up through the brew and producing a two finger head of white foam. The head has a modest level of retention, fading over time to leave a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. 
 
Smell – The aroma of the brew is strongest of sweeter smells of caramel and a decent showing of corn syrup. Along with these aromas comes a decent amount of a metallic smell. 
 
Taste – The taste begins with a mix of a bready, light caramel, and corn cereal taste mixed with a bit of a metallic flavor. The metallic flavor gets stronger in nature as the taste advances all while the bready and the corn fade a bit. All the while a bit of a cardboard flavor develops and with a loss much of the caramel, one is left with a somewhat off metallic and cardboard corny taste to linger on the tongue. 
 
Mouthfeel – The body of eh brew is on the slightly thicker side (for a 5 % adjunct lager) with a carbonation level that was average. A little thinner body may have been slightly better for the mix of caramel and corn upfront and may have downplayed some of the off flavors slightly better. Overall the feel was not all that bad though 
 
Overall – Not the tastiest of brews, but for the cheap price it is actually a decent go too. A good party brew.",2.87

Desperados,"I did not expect to have something like this while in Belgium. This clear burnt golden beer was served with a lime in its somewhat gaudy bottle much like a Corona. LOL. 
 
Drinking the first few sips after removing the lime, it kind of reminds me of tequila barrel aged Turbo Shandy, in that it has a bit of a honey character that comes off stronger than the botanicals, and is a little on the sweeter side. There's perhaps a touch of toasted corn far in the background, but it's pretty one note...thus, the lime.",3.03
Desperados,"Poured from a 330ml bottle. 
 
Pours dark straw with a tight bubbled head and high carbonation. The smell is soapy, weirdly sweet and citrusy and the taste follows on . The sweetness is so off-putting, they use glucose syrup in this and you can taste it strongly . It is also somehow unpleasantly bitter in a chemical feeling way . The mouthfeel is mostly syrup and fizz .  
Overall, why is this popular? Probably fashion and a pretty high abv . It's like a bad lager mixed with a sprite with tequila in there somewhere but it's all gone wrong .",1.94

Desperados,"Appearance: Pours a golden, crystal clear body. No appreciable head formation as it instantly crackles away like a Sprite. 
 
Smell: The D smells of four generous pumps of raunchy tequila-flavored syrup into a low-grade cheapo lager. 
 
Taste: Quite sugary - artificial lime and tequila additives abound. There seems to be an unenjoyable beer underneath, but it's difficult to discern beyond the tequila lollipop candied deal. Long, loonnggg aftertaste with a weird, chemically twang and final pop of artificial sweetness. 
 
Mouthfeel: Thin-bodied. Soda pop-esque carbonation, kinda fizzly. 
 
Overall: Unpleasantly sweet, remorselessly chemically.",1.73
Desperados,"This is the worst beer I've ever had. I have nothing positive to say about it. Like, cheap macrobrews get poor reviews because they're boring and uninspired. This isn't boring or uninspired, but I really wish it was. I imagine this is what it would taste like if you mixed Mike's Hard Lemonade with a Busch Light that was left out, half finished the morning after a frat party. Also a hint of cough syrup. Just truly disgusting. 
 
The look is fine, I guess. Fine enough that I thought this purchase could possibly be a good idea. Darker than one might expect, probably artificially colored, if I had to guess. The nose is stale and sweet. A little malty. The taste is like a collaboration between flavors that hate each other. Again, stale and sweet. Slightly acidic maybe, like citric acid was added or something. I don't detect any tequila flavors. None of the vegetal qualities that define tequila. Honestly, I don't think this is even beer. Closer to a flavored malt beverage, but I would pick any flavor of Four Loko over this.

Brilliantly-clear, gold liquid; foam fireworks upon pour, head gone in 20 sec... smells like corn syrup flavored hard candy, maybe approaching cough drop territory with its slightly medicinal ethanol; bland expression... tastes like bad malt liquor (stop) mixed with discarded Woodchuck cider and left out on the coffee table overnight after a party; cider-blast; virtually no aftertaste; subsequent sips taste mostly of enhanced corn liquid tainted with malt snot... as far as mouthfeel, it's practically champagne!...  
 
this is in the running for arguably the worst malt liquor that's crossed my lips (it's not quite the worst, on second thought); what a roller coaster ride these past couple days with some of the worst to the best brands I've ever had; this is trash, redeemed only by not having an aftertaste reminder of the trauma you've just experienced (2180)",2.5

Aromas of lemon, cracker, corn, white bread dough, and lightly toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness.

Nicely clean lager flavors; not overly fruity/yeasty. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and spicy alcohol. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a creamy/bready/grainy, and fairly crisp/sticky mouthfeel that is good. A tad rough, but smooth to sip on. Mild increasing warmth of 10.6%, with minimal lingering booze after the finish. Overall this is a solid high gravity malt liquor.

Look - Label looks like it was made in Microsoft Word. I somehow doubt it was ""ice brewed for extra smooth taste,"" probably just for more alcohol. The 10.6% is not nearly as advertised as I thought it would be. The beer itself is a decent golden color, looks better than some other offerings. 
 
Smell - Immediately after opening, strong wafts of sweet corn and wet grains. Nothing too special, but nothing bad. 
 
Taste - A surprising first hint of sweet and pleasant caramel malt, but immediately overpowered by a strong alcohol flavor. If it was a lower percentage, it might actually be good. 
 
Feel - Carbonation and body are fine, but the alcohol burn is mighty powerful. Your throat will sting, and your sinuses will be cleared.

Black Label Beer,"Pours a pale golden-straw in color, and as clear as can be.  
 
Not much to go on in the nose or aroma segment. It’s inoffensive, neutral and “clean”, with malt character dominating the (very low in character, anyway) corn syrup. No hop presence whatsoever. 
 
Light and somewhat crisp on the first sip. Sweetish. As with the nose, an inoffensive character, with little in the way of malt depth by which anyone might find interest or something to engage in, or even to recommend to another lover of characterful lager, real ale, or Craft Beer. Finish using the dry side, for what it’s worth. 
 
“Boring and inoffensive” is not the sort of phrase I’d use to recommend a beer to anyone else, but in the right circumstances that’s exactly the sort of beer that’s called for, and Black Label fits the bill most of the time. 
 
And it’s cheap, too! Well, a quarter or more higher in price than the lowliest of the low in the malt liquor category (211), but when you’re on a budget and want a brand to relax with but not get crunk on, this is a go-to — if you can even find it.* 
 
Not recommended for people who have little sense of humor in an increasingly absurd world. For the fact is, with Taprooms opening on every block in every major city, it won’t be long before retailers will refuse to stock rubbish such as this, owing to the fact that there’s so much local Craft Beer in cans nowadays. Rejoice, motherxxxxxxx! 
 
* (For some reason it’s got a presence in cold boxes in Minneapolis and Saint 
Paul, which was not one of its original markets back when Carling and later Carling-National moved down from Canada to become a big player in the brewing industry in the U.S.A. The glory days of Mabel! But I digress. 
 
At any rate, the market presence is probably due more to the consolidation of brands and brand swapping that went on when Heileman closed and Pabst and Miller split up some of the available brands.)",3

Look - something is off here. It pours a golden color, not unlike a macro adjunct, but it has a haze to it that just doesn't seem to be right. Remember Buffalo Bill from Silence Of The Lambs? Yeah... looks kinda like that. Upgraded from 1 to 1.25 as it does have some (fast dissipating) head that settles into a surprisingly nice little foam ring. 
 
Smell - nothing... No, I'm serious... literally NOTHING! Had to bring my wife over and ask for verification. She said she got something, but it was very subtle. Once it warms a bit it does get somewhat of sweet grain odor, but it never REALLY develops a proper smell. 
 
Taste - ""Naturally Brewed"" my a**... There ain't nothing natural about this s***... Prior to the first sip, I ran in place a bit... like when a God fearing human being sees a wasp on the patio. Fear and anxiety ensued. HOWEVER... tasting in wasn't quite as bad as confronting the evil that is the wasp (seriously... one of God's sick little jokes). While this is one step away from worshiping the Devil, it does develop some adjunct flavor as it warms. I never thought I'd appreciate grainy, corny adjunct nastiness... but it was a nice distraction from the actual flavor of this ""beer."" 
 
SIDE NOTE - many have complained about the booziness of this beer... I honestly cannot taste the alcohol (even at 10.6%) over the overall yucky blah in this so-called ""lager."" 
 
Feel - it's carbonated. I think. 
 
Overall - I feel like I need a Bible, an old priest and a young priest... the fact that I drank 24 oz of this is proof that I am not living right with Jesus.",1.22
Camo Silver Ice,Grabbed it just to see how bad it was. Even as a poor college kid there is better beer i fan afford. I think Budweiser is much better. That's..... saying something... Drank a Victory Moon Glow and Firestone Walker Wookey Jack to clease the palate :D,1.62

Yeah..we'll see about that. 
 
L - Poured see through piss yellow without any trace of a head 
 
S - This one smelled like some booze. Not good booze either. More of the kinda booze that leaves an ever present headache of bastard children after a one night stand turns into an unwanted.comittment and a shotgun wedding type of booze. 
 
T - Tases like grain alcohol had geschlechsverkher with a stalk of pesticide ridden corn. 
 
F - Numbing at least. 
 
O - This may rival steel reserve in terms of worst beer I've ever consumed.",1.08

T - Corn flakes, matzo bread. Underlying sweetness. Mild grass finish. 
F - Medium carbonation. Crisp and clean finish. Very light body. 
O - A low alcohol content does not always a terrible beer make. Unfortunately, this is a pretty bad brew. I have yet to have a normal Busch, but the bar is set pretty low here. Reminds me of a Miller Lite. Will not purchase again, and I highly recommend staying away from this one.",1.39
Busch NA,"For what it is not that bad. Has nice carbonation. Malty taste, nothing on bitterness but refreshing and zesty. This is a great alternative when alcohol is not an option. Cheap too, just like the real thing.",3
Busch NA,"Busch NA is a very transparent very pale straw with a short lasting foamy head. It smells of corn and something of crackers. The taste is corny and the sweetness, while not too strong, is unbalanced. The aftertaste is an unpleasant corn taste. The feel is very watery with some bubbles. Overall, it is Busch without alcohol.",1.54
Busch NA,"I have been drinking NA beers for 2 months now due to reasons beyond my control. This one is not great, but unlike 75% of the ones I have tried so far, is not offensive. Tastes like a watered down macro. Does not have the wort flavor or the off flavors of many other NAs. And, the price is right. 
Let's face it, no one drinks NA beer because they prefer it to the real versions. This one is not disgusting, which puts it in the upper 25%.",2.38
Busch NA,,2.1
Busch NA,"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is dominated by corn. Taste is also corn heavy, some malts are present. Feels medium/light bodied in the mouth and overall it's not bad if you enjoy liquified corn, but otherwise is a below average example of this style.",2.88
Busch NA,"I can no longer find this product locally. This NA beer blew me away the first time I tried it. The reason was it was the lowest price NA beer on the shelf, and the taste was very acceptable. Then I couldn’t find it for a while, and once it came back, the taste was noticeably more watery. Do you think they could have changed the recipe ? It was still OK, but now it has disappeared again.",3.89
Busch NA,"Not actually all that bad. Actually a fair tasting beer. I would not drink it on a consistent basis, but I could see some times where high volume drinking is required, this might warrant consideration.",2.5
Busch NA,"I'm rating this compared to the arsenal of crappy mass produced American beer. Which I almost never drink. But in the defense of Bush NA, this tastes every bit like a Miller Light. I really can't taste the difference. If you are a Miller Light fan and want to not get drunk, I think you'd rate this beer a 5. Seriously. It tastes better than Busch Light.  
 
Maybe there should be an NA section on Beer Advocate where we rate NAs next to their alcohol equivalent. Then this is hands down a 5. 
 
If you like mediocre imported beer, then go for a Heineken 0.0. I can't tell the difference between that and it's alcohol counterpart. That's also a 5 on the NA scale",3.35
Desperados,"The first words out of my mouth were, ""holy shit, what were they thinking?"" 
 
Sugar, buttered toast, sugar, and more sugar on the nose. Mouthfeel is not insubstantial, but nothing special. Tastes like someone mixed Budweiser with Sprite, added a few drops of tequila, and a feckton of sugar. I had to add some Guinness to make it palatable—and even then I couldn't finish it. 
 
Cannot recommend this Frankenstein's monster of a 'bier'.",1.81
Desperados,,1.28
Desperados,"Desperate. This so undrinkable for any beer-lover. Perhaps the worst beer in the world, alongside Corona and Cubanisto. Truly awful. Stay clear from this stuff.",1.33
Desperados,"Didn’t want to rate this as a beer, despite the deceptive “lager” appearance. Although upon closer inspection the carbonation is nothing like a true beer. It’s more like a wine cooler. If you look at it that way, there’s less sugar in this...drink...than a wine cooler, so not too awful. Came close to pouring this down the drain but something about it kept me wanting to drink it. Will not buy again, despite the cheap buzz.",2.09
Camo Silver Ice,In retrospect (about 10 years since I've had one of these) they're terrible. But I suppose they're bearable when you're a broke college kid.,1.26

Served in a pint glass 
 
Look: 
Straw color with brilliant clarity. Head is bright white with great head retention and a meringue-like head with small bubble texture. 
 
Smell: 
High levels of bready, yeasty malt aromas that are followed up by moderate levels of sulfur, presumably from the bottom fermenting lager yeast. Seems somewhat high for a lager, however. No detectable hop aromas which causes the beer to smell overly malty, similar to old/stale beer. 
 
Taste: 
Bready malt flavors followed by the yeast flavor. Low levels of hop bitterness with a low level of grassy, spicy hop flavor. Hops are barely detectable. Sulfur and DMS flavors are low to moderate. More moderate as the beer warms. Balance is all malt (bready) and fermentation character (yeast, sulfur, DMS). Not a pleasant drinking experience. 
 
Feel: 
Moderate levels of carbonation. Light bodied. No lingering harshness or creaminess. No alcohol warmth (obviously). Mouthfeel is typical of adjunct lager style. 
 
Overall: 
Beer looks good and the mouthfeel is typical, but the aroma and flavor are pretty terrible. I wouldn't drink this unless I had to. Best bet is to find a better non-alcoholic beverage.",1.95

Kirin Light Beer,"i definitely dont think its fair or correct that this is rated as the 55th worst beer in the world here on BA, i totally disagree, and while its not among the best in this light international lager space, its certainly not among the worst beers on the planet. i like the new art on it, more modern than what is pictured here, and i always enjoy these asian ones in the large format, never seen this one before now i dont think. anyway the pour is impossibly light, lesser than straw colored, pretty clear, and actually with a pretty and puffy pure white inch of head on it, it looks right on actually, with lots of carbonation rising up and a nice light golden shine. the nose is minimal, but its less chemical and cheap and obviously adjuncty than so many others, maybe faintly metallic, but not unappealing at all, very little hops here but not totally invisible in the aroma, lager yeast evident too, although also very minimal. the flavor starts off rather refreshing, generically grainy to me but nothing weird, its thin in feel but the carbonation is so high it never feels watery. its only at the end where it gets a little yucky, a strange bitterness rises up, hints of rubber and wet paper, and it lingers through the very dry finish unpleasantly on the tongue, not sure what this is, its an unfamiliar flaw, almost lightly smoky somehow, a faint molten plastic element too, but really kind of distinct to this. a shame because it was cooking along just fine before this. still, it doesnt ruin this drink, and this ended up being a fine sushi companion, way better than its ratings here, especially compared against only similar items. not sure why this has fallen so far down the list, id drink it again...",2.93

In several major markets around the world, the Beer audience has fallen since 2016, as beer drinking becomes more fragmented and drinkers drink in Japan when audiences are mostly asleep in the United States and Europe. 
 
While data from the opening beer ceremony and first few nights of beer events indicate that the Kirin Light is the least drank Beer in recent history across Europe and in the United States. However, drinking Kirin Light is up in Australia and Japan.

Corona Extra,"Gets a 5 for look in the bottle, or a 1.25 out of the bottle. It's an amazing design and the font is unbelievable. This time I drink out of the bottle, so it gets a 5. 
 
Rereviewing after just drinking a Corona Premier, to compare. That is probably the worst beer I have ever had. I do like the bottle design and the Stegosauruses, however I am reviewing the beer, not the artwork. 
 
Rather a pale colour, similar to most beers from Mexico. Aroma is almost nothing, with a little lime. And there is no lime or lemon added ; ) The aroma is a little better than the Premier version. 
 
Taste is so light, I'm completely confused as to why there is also a light version and a Premier version that are even lighter. Hops are mega subtle. But they work well with the lightness. This is much better than the ""Premier"" version. In hot weather I guess this is kind of good and refreshing. 
 
Mouth feel is ok. The hops kind of hit you after the initial wateryness. The mouth feel is the best thing about this. And it was the worst thing about the Premier version. 
 
Overall this isn't as bad (without lime) as I was expecting. It's much much better than the Premier. Beer Advocate reviewing seriously need to wake up as this actually has a much lower score. 
 
As a light beer, this is actually ok. I'm just confused why they decided to create even lighter beers! I feel like if they created another one, I would hover. Maybe if I go to Mexico and live in temperatures each day of 40 centigrade and sweat about mafia murdering me because of giving bad reviews to Corona Premier, I would also like Corona Premier?

Crest Super Premium Lager,"Drinking this from a can, can't comment on the look.  
 
Smell is pretty non-existant to my nose, little bit of fruit/ lemon. Not bad, not great.  
 
Taste is syrupy and sweet, with more lemon-y flavours and a bitterness that creeps up as you swallow. Not really complex, but not terrible. No sight of those ""Finest German Aromatic Hops"" though, more just bitterness without flavour. Honestly, I don't hate it. Could be more complex or backed up with hops but besides being a bit cloyingly sweet it really is not bad.  
 
Mouth feel is syrupy, kind of thick because of the sweetness. Not dry, although there is bitterness which develops on the finish.  
 
Overall - I don't hate it like a lot of people on here. Is it excellent, highbrow beer? No. But for what it is, it honestly isn't terrible. Not too much liquor forward in my opinion, tastes strong but not 10%. I would like some more hops and flavour besides the sweetness, some orange or grapefruit would balance that... Not great, but not terrible. If you want a buzz for cheap, go for it. And it's better than the average American piss-in-a-can any day.",3.06

EKU-28 comes to mind. Syrupy, cloying flavors! And not good flavors! I have found that cutting this with half water makes it drinkable. I have this around in case I run out of ale that I brew. It gets things started quickly, if you know what I mean. It's basically a malt liquor for white people. Attention commercial brewers: It is much easier and less expensive to brew a high alcohol ale that tastes great than to attempt the same with a lager. Why are you not pursuing this? There is a market for a wonderful, high alcohol ale...in a CAN!!! Do it!!! Still, I would probably keep this around for emergencies. Just add water for drinkability.",1
Crest Super Premium Lager,My favourite beer.,4.66
Crest Super Premium Lager,"500ml can, a sort of surprise new offering from the Wells & Young's group to suddenly show up here in Alberta (for the second time, it would appear!). The ‘finest German aroma hops’, eh? WTF? Was this actually made in the country that originated the English language? 
 
This beer pours a clear, bright medium golden amber colour, with two chubby fingers of puffy, rocky, and bubbly eggshell white head, which leaves some splendid bonsai tree forest lace around the glass as it quickly abates. 
 
It smells of sickly sweet apples and pears, gritty caramel malt, yeasty rising bread, lemon furniture polish, and some strangely stanky, um, strange (ok, hops, I suppose, but man are they musky). The taste is gritty and grainy caramel, well, ‘flavouring’, dead yeast cells, pome fruit-heavy Yuk-a-Flux, further near gag-inducing industrial alcohol warming notes, and a distinct lack of the finest of German hops never to be seen in a shit show like this. 
 
The bubbles are quite underwhelming in their barely perceptible frothiness, the body a so-so middleweight, as if buoyed by some unfamiliar sugar source, and not really all that smooth, not with that pithy, cheap-ass booziness loafing about. It finishes still pretty sweet, but all tainted here, and musty and dead-seeming there. Gah. 
 
Yeah, this is not a craft brew, by any stretch of the imagination, which is a bit of a shame, given the predilections of the parent brewing concern (Courage, Bombardier, etc), but it is a party-starter (or ender, depending on one's constitution, I presume) - Euro malt liquor swill, incarnate.

This NA beer poured with a 2 finger head that disappeared quickly. 
It gave off a nice light beer aroma from the head. 
The taste was that of beer malt and hops flavored seltzer water. 
The overall taste and body was that of Miller Lite WITHOUT any corn taste.",2.66
Coors Non-Alcoholic,I travel a lot for my sons High School athletics and enjoy a few good beers when I get home. Sometimes it takes a couple of our and do not want to risk a DWI. I found the Coors NA on the shelf and thought I would give it a try. I was blown away with the taste. I could not believe how great it tasted for a NA Beer. It totally satisfies my craving for the beer taste without the alcohol in my system for driving. The only problem I have is finding it. I was just in Walmart and bought the last 6 pack.

Corona Extra,"This beer reminds me of every Dad’s refrigerator in the early 2000’s. It seemed like whenever I’d go over to a buddy’s house, this was the beer in their Dad’s fridge, so I think of that more than I do the cheesy beach commercials. I believe I had a Corona Extra at a bar over fifteen years ago, so this was pretty much like a first impression today. Corona Extra has the skunkiness of a Heineken, without any of the Heineken goodness. It tastes bitter, and not in a fun “beer” kind of way. I added lime to it, and now I totally understand why that’s a thing, but on its own I give it a very generous 2 out of 5.

Crest Super Premium Lager,"500 mL can picked up at TBS; best before June 19 2016 and served ice cold. This is a beer that I have intentionally avoided for nearly 10 years now, but I was feeling masochistic tonight.  
 
Pours a clear golden colour, capped off with one inch of frothy white head. It seeps away steadily over the next five minutes or so, eventually thinning out into a foamy cap and collar. Good lacing, too - visually this is a rather attractive lager, but aromatically I'd have to argue otherwise. Corn syrup, alcohol, wet cardboard, boiled vegetables and apples all come to mind, but ""quality lager"" most certainly does not. To quote a certain fictitious news anchor, I immediately regret this decision. 
 
Not quite as awful as I'd anticipated, but still one of the worst beers I've had in years. Very saccharine, with flavours of corn syrup and cotton candy dominating at first. This is, surprisingly enough, countered by some weedy, grassy hop extract bitterness, but the truly off-putting aftertaste totally blots out that faint beam of light. Little effort has gone into masking the alcohol content, which is noticeable throughout the sip - but it really reaches its climax after you swallow a gulp. At that point, this beer begins to taste the way that compost water and paint thinner smell. Light-medium in body, with appropriately assertive carbonation levels. The alcohol burn is so significant that it almost seems to have a numbing effect on the tongue.  
 
Final Grade: 1.98, a miserable F. Crest Super Premium Lager is more of a fraternity hazing supply or a solvent than a beer. In fact, it is easily one of the worst alcoholic beverages that I can recall consuming over the past decade - and consume I did, all the way to the bottom of the can, because I'm just that stubborn. Crest is shamelessly boozy, and I would judge no man or woman for pouring this swill down the drain. If you are drinking this simply to get drunk (and really, why else would you be?), prove that you have more self respect than me and buy yourself a mickey of whiskey or rum or something.",1.98

Budweiser,"I will attempt to cut through the hype and grade on a curve (""for the style""). Drank from a can dated 23DEC23, today is July 7th 2023. 
 
This is a pretty unremarkable beer. Any special malt characteristics are blended out, the grains being blended with 30% rice in the mash. There is a mild hop bitterness on the taste, pretty indistinct on the smell. What smell there is, is dominated by the beechwood chips added during the brewing. That part of the brew is unique and under-appreciated. Heavy carbonation, which is probably good in something so mild. 
 
There is nothing ""Awful"" about this brew - no off-flavors, nothing intensely artificial, no industrial alcohol vibe. Bland and light, but not so much as Bud Light, which takes better to warming. Make sure you drink these ice cold.",3.06

Beck's Premier Light,"First off, I am not a fan of light beers. But this doesn’t really taste like other light beers. True, it doesn’t have much color or body, but compared to every other “light” beer I have sampled, this beer hits it out of the park. It actually has some flavor. I have not tasted anything close to this that has only 64 calories. Plus, it only has 2.3% alcohol, perfect for hot summer days when you want to drink more than a few beers and still stay relatively sober. Given the low calorie and alcohol content, this is a superior product. 
 
I think most reviewers are being somewhat unfair with their reviews. If you lined up 10 other light beers along with this beer in a taste test, this beer would stand alone as real beer flavor. True, if you did the same comparison with 10 other non-light German style beers, it would finish last, but that would be unfair because this is a light beer.

Taste, very carbonated feel that leaves a really smooth texture on the tongue, a grassy, wheatie, slightly watery brew.

Contains corn syrup. As it's American, this is probably genetically modified. Oh well, I had a shit day and really need a beer, so fu ck it. Oh but it's brewed in the Czech Republic, so hopefully not. Who knows. 
 
Quite a pale colour...light head. Aroma is unexciting and pale like the appearance. Not that pale is an aroma, but it still describes it perfectly. Slightly ricey and corney. 
 
Taste is kind of ok in terms of the hops. It's kind of sweet with the corn syrup prominent. A little bit of a soggy cornflake taste. Hops are quite interesting and different from most German, Czech, Polish, Romanian, Dutch, Mexican and Belgian pilsners. But for me there is much too much corny sweetness, I wouldn't want to drink a lot of these, even though it is easy drinking. It's not crisp enough, or dry enough, to work as a refreshing or session beer, in my opinion. With a bit less corn syrup and more hops, and more alcohol, it could be ok. 
 
Feel is watery, with a little complexity in the hops and corn syrup.

A lot of flavor for 64 calories. Against other super low calorie beers the difference in taste, and feel, is remarkable. It is also filling like it's calorie high original. Though it does this by being quite foamy. The low alcohol content and filling quality of this beer means you can nurse them all night and not get drunk. You can sober up nursing a six pack of these! 
 
Cons: 
 
Bloated from the fizz. If you intent to get drunk by drinking this you might want to think again. You'd have to have a hearty ability to drink! 
 
Overall: I like this beer when I go to a poker party. Everyone wants to do shots and drink. But they don't know I'm drinking a beer that will sober you up. They assume it's German and therefore must have lots of alcohol. Great beer if you are the DD. You can nurse them and never get drunk.",2.87

Beck's Premier Light,"I recently made a field trip our to Subs & Six Packs on Columbia Avenue while running another errand. I saw this in the cooler & when I realized that I had never heretofore reviewed it, I seized upon the opportunity. 
 
From the bottle: ""Beck's Quality Brewed Under the German Purity Law of 1516"".  
 
I Pop!ped the cap only to get a wafting odor of old Noble hops and corn silage. Ugh. I upended the bottle to get it over with & briefly got two fingers of fizzy, foamy, bone-white head that quickly dissipated to wisps for my trouble. Color was Pale-Straw (SRM = 1 -2) with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled like Saaz hops that had seen better days, along with a corn malodor that did nothing for me. Ugh. Mouthfeel was thin & watery. Ugh. The taste was just more watered-down AAL, corn & Noble hops wasted in a brew that can only be intended for the uninitiated. Ugh. Finish left me with a good case of buyer's regret. Ugh.",1.92
Beck's Premier Light,"not all that bad for a light beer. It still has a full flavor and body to it unlike most light beers so that's a plus, a negative though is that it is super light on ABV% at 2.3% so you're gonna end up drinking a lot of them just to get a good buzz.",2.38

Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,"Purchased as a 24oz can, poured into a pint glass. 
 
A - Pours a golden color. Initially thick foamy white head recedes quickly; poor head retention and no lacing. Lots of small bubbles rising through the brew. 
 
S - Adjuncts, alcohol, and malty notes abound. ABV is not very well hidden here. 
 
T - Malt and sweet corn to start, with fusels and a faint sour apple flavor showing up on the finish. Not as egregiously tart as Stack 101 but it's noticeable. 
 
M - Thin-bodied with medium carbonation. It goes down relatively easily, but the mouthfeel of this HGL leaves much to be desired outside of that. 
 
O - It has a cool can design and the product is inoffensive enough not to be a drain pour, but nothing about it really invites me to try it again. Tick complete. Reviewed to style, YMMV.",2.24

Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,"A random pickup from a local wine store's cooler, I couldn't ask for a lower price on a themed drink to go alongside my D&D game later that day, which featured a similar dog creature. 
 
The upsides of this beer stop about there.  
 
While not bad, nothing about this beer stood out from under the label. Drinking straight from the can, I can't speak of colour or clarity, though a lager that doesn't try to coat me with the head foam as I open it isn't trying hard enough. 
 
The most appealing feature of this brew seems to be the 24oz can of 8% ABV for around $2, since I'd compare it to the big brand light beers, but trying too hard to be bursting with the wrong sort of flavours.",2.68
Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,"Drank from a 24 ounce can. Scores are based on the style. 
 
Look - Very attractive, almost looks like a fancy craft beer. Stands out nicely on the shelf. Doesn't look at all like a malt liquor. 
 
Smell - Tiny wisp of corn, mostly metallic water. 
 
Taste - Like a brownie covered in black pepper. Incredibly sweet, slightly chocolatey, and a strong alcohol bite. 
 
Feel - Thin body, very mild fizz, and some throat burn. It needs to either be thicker or bubblier. 
 
Overall - I had low expectations based on its $1.50 price tag, and it hit them. It's not good, but it isn't offensive. I'd have it again, but it definitely wouldn't be a first pick.",1.94

Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,"Why am I rating this? The hell if I know, let's say desperate times call for desperate measures. 
Poured into what? Uhmmmm...just a regular pint glass. 
The appearance was a glossy clear yellow to mild orange color with speedy carbonation rising to fill a rapidly dieing head. No lace. 
The aroma had stiff sweet corn, rice, fusel alcohol and burnt grass. 
The flavor had a huge alcoholic sweet buffing throwing itself into burnt grass, burnt toast and sweet corn. The aftertaste was distracting through fusel alcohol, sweet corn and burnt grass and toast. 
The mouthfeel was between light and medium bodied with no sessionability whatsoever. It's a sipper by all means, that's if one wants to sip it. Carbonation did feel appropriate for what this is supposed to be. ABV seemed as projected. Finish was fusel alcohol, sweet corn and burnt toast. 
Overall, didn't really like this at all for me but without being too harsh, I realize this style doesn't really clean up too well. Keep trying, maybe a brewer out there eventually will be able to brew a kickass version of this. I seriously doubt this brewery will.",2.05

S: strawberry Big League Chew - no other way to describe it... intense, but little booze presence... ok, well, yes the 'margarita' (lime) element does slowly emerge

F: it's not all-out syrupy, but there's definitely a concentrate or two slick-sliding though its core... for 8%, the booze is buried rather well... not laborious to swill; fantastically mellow in its alcohol presence, but nonetheless a tad too weighty (also mostly, entirely copied from my Lime-a-Rita review - finding out these things are one-note) 
 
O: thought the taste of this would wash out that of the 'flagship' Lime-a-Rita I just had moments ago, and boy was I right... this is seriously carbonated (malty) strawberry Mad Dog 20 20... the flavorings of these are to-taste with everyone, naturally, but 2 brands in, and it's apparent each variation was designed to appeal to an adolescent palate (1468)",2.88

Jaguar High Gravity Lager,"In honor of the recent lunacy in our neighbor state, I decided to go with a self-proclaimed ""union made"" beer out of Monroe, WI. Gotta love cans labeled with animals. Sconnies... 
 
A: Golden blonde with a weak white head. Good clarity and looks like a light summer beer. 
 
S: Corn, musty unidentified adjunct, and a bit of banana. Pretty mild, but what is there is not desirable. 
 
T: Sweet and fruity. Not sure where this is coming from, but I get lime and cloying banana. Strange, and not in a particularly good way. 
 
M; Smooth with fine carbonation and a bit of alcohol bite. 
 
Flavor is bizarre, like some Zima somehow found its way into the tank. This started out as a peculiarity, but by the time I finished the 22oz, it was a nauseating chore. Not quite bad enough to make the list of worst malt liquors, but this is classic SKIP ENJOYMENT AND GO STRAIGHT TO INTOXICATION.",1.81
Jaguar High Gravity Lager,"Served in a snifter. 
 
And SwillFest 1.5 rolls on! And in geodesic snifters, no less! What better vessel for such a libation, eh? When I saw this can a few months ago, my mind pulled for me to purchase it. But I demurred. Then, upon seeing this on a more recent beer run to Kenosha, I felt it had to come into my possession. 
 
Which leads to today. it pours a clear apple juice topped by a finger or so of quick-dying white foam. The nose is indeed how Senor Chandler (below) described it, with cotton candy stalks dancing with remnants of vinyl and motor oil (I don't get the rest of the factory, but, then again, I ain't Woody, be I?). The simple strangeness of it is actually pretty impressive, though in the wrong way. The taste takes a slightly different tack, more closely resembling some yammy WD-40. Yeah. Seriously. This is some godawful shit, lemme tell ya. The body feels heavier than it probably is (bad tastes weigh more than good ones, maybe?), with a light moderate carbonation, a watery feel, and a dry finish. Overall, nothing about this horrid thing makes me want to ever drink it again. It was all I could do to muster up the strength to down the rest of my glass, hoping against hope that only the minimum would actually touch my tongue and harangue my 'buds. Only one word for this: Yicchleggh. 
 
On a strange note, feeling oddly empowered (if that's the right word), I decided to add some Tabasco to what remained in my glass after emptying the can. I dripped in some of Mike's old sauce (best by label read ""03/2010"") and gulped some down, much to the painful glee of those witnessing the act. To my surprise, the taste was akin to Crazy Ed's. Now where's the shooting star running over my head?",1.49

This beer is odd, but hell, it's JAGUAR. The taste felt like a jaguar mauled my taste buds. There is an acrid horrible feeling that I wish I had never ever EVER tasted. The mouthfeel is smooth but horrible, I don't know how else to describe it. The drinkability is DON'T.",1.68

It pours straw yellow with a head that vanishes faster than the beer. Nothing to report on the smell, just typical light lager scents. Taste-wise, its a metal can with corn notes that tastes like strange tap water. Now maybe I am being harsh, but it did go down smooth as its under 4% and is practically a water. Not good if you're looking for flavor and body in your beer, but great after getting knocked down by a heavy marg.",2
Tecate Light,"Look: Clear straw gold, loose white head that dissipates after a few minutes.  
 
Smell: Light sulfur, mineral water. Not a lot going on.  
 
Taste: Since they cut calories with the abv and kept more carbs, it’s way more flavorful than I expected. There’s the typical corn adjunct, some breadiness, a little earthy hops and a crisp, dry finish. It’s not outstanding but there’s no way I can call it “awful”. At 3.9% you could drink this all day long. I am pleasantly surprised. 
If your into micheladas, this would be a great starting pointe. If you don’t know what they are, mix 1/3 Clamato with 2/3 beer, add some Tabasco if you like it spicier. I’ve also made them with the same ratio and zing zang Bloody Mary mix.",3.34

Amsterdam Maximator,"Managed to get to the review box without seeing previous ones...yesss..! It's difficult. 
 
Left out the fridge for 30 minutes before drinking. 
 
Initial impressions, I do not like the green can much. For me green is not beer. It's the devil or maybe wheatgrass juice or broccoli. 
 
For a strong beer at 11.6%, it is very light. Basically like a lager, with a bit more colour. Head goes down fast. 
 
Aroma has no fruitiness, nothing complex...just fizziness and a hint of sawdust. 
 
Not looking forward much to the taste... 
 
Taste is intense, spirit like. Much better than a lager like Carlsberg or Heineken, as at least there is taste. Though the taste is alcohol, almost vodka, and not a complex brewed taste with lots of flavour, This is obviously made for the alcohol, not the taste. The perfect beer for someone who hates their life, wants to get drunk, forget things, and who wants to save money as much as possible.  
 
Would I drink if I was homeless..? For sure. There is fuck all else to do and I probably do not want to break another tooth opening a bottle of Chimnay Bleu.  
 
The taste has elements of honey, lots of sweetness (surprising for such a strong beer).  
 
It's my opinion that the ingredients are false. They have basically mixed beer with pure alcohol and sugar. Therefore alcohol should be on the ingredients. Perhaps they do not have to add this as a seperate one...haha clever. 
 
This has not been brewed, it has been mixed. 
 
Still, it's better than a mass produced lager. Though, really it is the same, just mixed with alcohol. So it gets a pretty low rating from me...",1.43

Colt 45 Malt Liquor,"Got a 24oz can best by August 1st poured into my warsteiner pils glass just for fun. 
 
On the pour a 1ish finger head forms then becomes fizzy amd recedes to a ring around the glass amd light covering. Crystal clear generic lager color, a light straw gold, with lively carbonation. Looks like a decent cheap beer. And it almost wants to lace 
 
The nose is surprisingly decent especially for the style. Some slight green apple off notes right up front, but not too far behind is an actual bready malt aroma that is present, possibly even some cheap but detectable hops on the nose. There is a bit of oxidized notes but this is way better than Olde English 800 for sure. As it warms the green apple flavor grows and becomes almost unpleasant but it's really just a cheap lager note that I get a lot in AAL beers a lot more than I'm getting in this one. 
 
Flavor follows the aroma bringing a bit of corniness along with the malts. The hops largely disappear leaving only a hint of bitterness right up front that mingles with a bit of the green apple, then gives way to a largely pleasant and almost soft bready and corny malt/grain flavor. Coming in with low expectations I was very pleasantly surprised.  
 
Feel is at first sip a bit watery with a quick finish and a big hit of carbonation bite, but as you drink more it hits the stomach quite heavily making this quite filling, which is a bit of a curve ball after everything else about this beer made me forget that technically this is a malt liquor. No complaints really however as this is the only spot that has even been close to reminding me what kind of beer I'm drinking. 
 
Overall I've had beers that where a whole lot worse than this. Obviously I've had better but this is almost a decent American style lager. And at only 5.6% it's really not all that big a beer by today's standards. The only thing really making this a malt liquor is that it's been around since the only choices were bud miller and coors and it's a bit stronger than those BMC beers.

Fades to a chunky wisp and leaves foamy, chunky wisp on the sides of the glass. Splotchy wisp leaves some foamy lacing down the glass.  
 
SMELL: Bread and grainy malts, corn, and some alcohol.  
 
TASTE: Rough going. Boozy and sweet grain up front, with sweet bread and corn into the finish. A bolder finish is boozy with alcohol, corn and sweet grainy malts. Not pleasant in the least. Harsh.  
 
PALATE: Medium body and carbonation. A little light, goes down airy and bubbly with a harsh burn at swallow and finishes slightly sweet on palate. Some alcohol lingers.  
 
OVERALL: Not a doppelbock at all. This is simply a strong Euro pale lager, and a really strong one at that.

Bud Light Platinum,"Handwritten notes from 10+ years ago. 
 
Appearance - Clear straw body. Very clear and pale. Very active carbonation in the head. Sounds like a soda more than a beer. Head lasts for a minute then disappears completely. No lace. 3 
 
Smell - Alcohol and musky corn. A little thick and gummy. Very much like a malt liquor. 3 
 
Taste - Stale and musky. Tastes much better straight from the bottle for some reason. Pretty clean. Some faint artificial sweetness, like splenda. Almost flavorless. A more alcoholic Michelob Ultra. 3.5 
 
Mouthfeel - Slight crispness. Leaves faint stick on tongue, but very clean. 3

Bud Light Platinum,"I think there are far too many opinions due to this beer being the American beer category, but I completely disagree with most of them. It doesn’t taste or smell disgusting like many reviewers say, in fact I truly believe that most of the negative reviews are beer drinkers that typically don’t drink light beers or what they call “adjuncts” but I think this is a fairly decent tasting beer!",4.22
Bud Light Platinum,,2.65
Bud Light Platinum,"Light beers need a different scale. The whole point is hopefully getting the best taste possible along with low cals/carbs. If you can somehow sneak some extra ABV in there, all the better. So this one ticks all of those boxes, and this coming from someone who can't stand Bud Light. The taste here is the typical A-B soapy water, but it isn't offensive, especially cold out of a bottle. No aftertaste, which is good for this style. Also low on gassiness. 
 
Yeah, of course it's far from a quality sipping beer, but in terms of the reasons why light beers exist, it nails them. If you're familiar with another 130 cal, 5 carb, 6.0% ABV beer, let me know! All the light/session IPAs of recent years tend to be about 4.0% ABV, and taste like overly fizzy junk anyway.",2.95

St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,"Poured from a clear 40 best by June 5th 2023 
 
On a relatively hard pour, 2 fingers of dense sticky head form that becomes rocky and over time, surprisingly slowly fades. Body is a deep, verging on dark, golden yellow. Surprisingly decent lacing forms. Good head quality and retention. 
 
Aroma is not quite present. Acetaldehyde green apple is very present, with a dry light graininess in the back. Maybe a bit skunky, but not quite as much as OE800. Smells like cheap beer that got warm. 
 
Taste is a bit more smooth than the aroma with a touch of bready and biscuity malt, but only after the aforementioned acetaldehyde bitter/tart/off apple flavor passes. The flavor is not as sweet as Steel Reserve, and not as sweet as Hurricane, but the acetaldehyde is just a bit too much. Still drinkable. 
 
Feel is actually quite decent, especially for the ABV. Not too heavy or syrupy, but the feel is obviously full bodied. There is a definite dryness and astringency that grows as you drink. Very drinkable if not quite refreshing. Definitely a laid back lazy day sorta beer. 
 
Overall it's a decent high gravity lager, but I do slightly prefer Steel Reserve over this. Closing words, it's fine, but drink it cold.",2.62

Smell - Not much of anything, just a slight corny sweetness. 
 
Taste - Buttery shortbread cookies and refreshing malt flavor. No off-putting bitterness and surprisingly little alcohol taste for the high ABV. An easy drinker. 
 
Feel - Smooth and silky. Just the right amount of carbonation. Goes down good.

The taste is sweet, slick, corn sugary liquor. Minimal to zero bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a decidedly undry finish. Overall, ok malt liquor. The diacetyl is not overpowering and awful here. Also not the cleanest example and not one I would purchase again.",3.53
St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,"Shame this has such a low rating. Pansies. 
Poured into a frosty mug out of a 40 oz bottle. Because... you can't get a good proper aroma in the 40. Sue me.  
Anyhow. 
Aroma: wonderful, malty, hint of movie popcorn with butter. Is that really that bad when there are beers out now intended on tasting like peanut butter or smelling like grapefruit? No. Not at all. Cry about it! 
Appearance: Wonderful head, like my ex gave before she wrecked my life and married some other guy in 4 months. In all seriousness, beautiful appearance in a mug. Looks like a macro beer in an advertisement. Darker color than most AALs. Instagram worthy.  
Taste: Ice cold? Smooth, crisp, hides the potency of the girthy liquid quite well. Warmed up a bit? Good. Yes. Good. Don't be a stereotypical snob. There are floral notes here, along with some hoppy characteristics. Tastes like it would cost you 3 times more with some crazy label touting independence from the big bad macro evil guys. Because it is hip to be square. Right? 
Buzz: You need a buzz rating. If you don't do one, you're lying to yourself... if you consumed a beer of high ABV and posted a review on some godforsaken website. Like I did! 10/10. Increases luck with the ladies, much added confidence. Hey, it's how I met my ex mentioned earlier, one St Ides and I was in 3 hour sex romps and meeting a totally dysfunctional family from the seventh layer of hell before I knew it! Don't take my word for it. Get you a 40 oz of St Ides today, before Pabst kills off this legacy brand to help fight ""racism"" or some such trite shit. It is good. And it gets you feeling like you discovered liquid weed. Also helps you deal with an insane sociopath destroying your life with her delusions! Incredible brew.",4.85

Mouthfeel is crisp, easy drinkability, with a slight boozy warmness. Overall, dead on for the style of a malt liquor/strong lager.

Nice spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Some fruity corn aromas, but not too overwhelming. Okay aromas with pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with decent strength. Taste of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, floral, woody, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Very clean on lager flavors, with minimal fruity/yeasty notes. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and fairly sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Minimal warming alcohol for 5.9%. Overall this is a nice malt liquor. All around nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and pretty refreshing to drink with the mellowly bitter/drying finish. Very clean and nicely rich pils malt/grain showcase, with nice earthy hop presence/balance for the style. Not too overwhelming on adjuncts.

Its a real refreshing beer very different that those lime beer. I got to tell u won t get drunk with that beer very easily.

Feel: Medium-bodied, strong carbonation. Full, creamy, and very smooth. (4.50) 
 
Overall: Not a huge fan of the style, but if anyone does it right, it's right here. Pours beautifully. Classic English bittersweet aromas.

The flavor is very robust and deep with a noticeable but by no means overpowering sweetness and a slightly astringent, burnt bitterness to close. Full-bodied with a very luxurious smooth (almost syrupy) mouthfeel and subtle carbonation.

Milk Stout,"Poured from a 12oz bottle best by 02/05/2023 
 
On the pour one finger of fine tan head formed then recedes to a decent covering and ring that leaves nice lacing, but continues dissipating. Body is a solid black even up to light, I wish there was a bit more head though. 
 
Aroma is dark and smooth. Like a better, sweeter, and ever so slightly fruitier guiness. Dark chocolate with a hint of roast, verging on coffee with some sweet malty notes make up this one. Slight hops are present but they blend in nicely and are mostly bittering. 
 
Taste follows the aroma with even more roasty almost bitter malts that are quickly balanced by a molasses dark chocolate sweetness. The roast comes out even more in the finish with true and smooth roasty barley making up the aftertaste, retaining some sweetness. 
 
Feel is laid back, smooth, and easy drinking, but still has that cozy ""vibe"" that a good stout should bring. Not too thick or syrupy but still quite full. Quite attenuated despite the sweetness and is almost dry bit not quite with a slight mouthcoating maltiness. 
 
Overall this was exactly what I was looking for. For a slightly chilly early fall night, after drinking too many lagers, a nice dark ale was in order, but I didn't want too many hops or to go too heavy. This is close to refreshing but has a laid back armchair vibe to it as well. Versatile, refreshing, and roasty.",4.09

The taste is about what you expect from the nose. The roasted barley blends well with moderate hops, and the milk sweetens the chocolatey stout. I expected a stickier consistency, but the mouthfeel is nicely balanced... the taste and feel is quite clean and refreshing, compared to a typical stout.

Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,"Poured very dark brown and capped with an ambitious light brown head that climbed three inches very quickly. 
The aroma to my chemically damaged nose was mild but still featured proper porter smells- roasted malts, coffee, a touch of chocolate. 
The taste- I grabbed the can again to verify, but vanilla plays top position. Not sweet at all, but no mistaking there is vanilla in here. Coffee shows up later, this drinks true as it warmed. 
The feel was good, ideal even. Not sure if it could be better. Ideally viscous.

Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,"2021 release from can. Poured from fridge temp. Pours black with a really good amount of light brown head. Sticks around for quite a while as well. Nose is incredible. Vanilla, marshmallow, coffee, dark chocolate, red licorice, burnt toffee, and a nice amount of dark fruit. The taste nicely follows the nose, but with a distinct bitterness on the back end. Vanilla and coffee (very dark) are dominant. Definitely some charred wood, black licorice, roasted malts, almonds, and tar. Not sweet at all. Mouthfeel is fairly thick. Overall a really nice coffee stout.",4.21

Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,"After being impressed by the High West BA version of this a few weeks ago I figured I'd give this a shot. Quite affordable at $3 for a single bottle given it currently sits at #323 of all time on this site 
 
Pours a very dark brown with just a finger of espresso colored head that quickly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing and decent legs 
 
The aroma here is sweet but not overly so, bringing a nice balance of vanilla, hazelnut, toast, milk chocolate, medium roast coffee, and a slight dark fruit note 
 
A bittersweet balance is maintained throughout the entire sip, starting off with notes of cocoa powder, lightly toasted malt, raisin, and a touch of grain alcohol. The swallow makes this one a bit sweeter, bringing notes of rich vanilla, slightly astringent coffee, milk chocolate, and almond 
 
A medium silky body pairs with gentle carbonation for a smooth slow sipper. The finish is mostly dry, due to the roasty character of the coffee 
 
Damn delicious beer right here. It hits all the notes expected and doesn't feel overly sweet or strong despite the high abv. I'd definitely get it again",4.37

Speedway Stout,"Look: Black as night and even my gentle pour initiates a billowing brown head that holds as a pillow and refuses to settle, eventually relenting and leaving sheets of lacing behind 
Aroma: Espresso, roasted barley, baker’s cocoa, ethanol, blackstrap molasses, freshly baked bread, dark cherries, light earthiness, and piloncillo 
Taste: Starts out with a ton of rich, dark chocolate that hinges on the edge of full-blown bitter cocoa and quickly joined by espresso, light cherry, and roast. These go back and forth with a nice bread/earthy profile in the middle with subtle caramel, molasses, and piloncillo hanging around, peeking in occasionally and closes with cocoa, coffee, and ethanol 
Mouthfeel: Full, silky smooth, medium carbonation, and a smooth finish with a slight robust edge 
Overall: This is outstanding stuff. I’ve only had this beer a few times in my craft beer experience and I forgot just how well-made and tasty it is, especially for such a big beer.

The taste reminds me of powdered unsweetened cocoa. The body is full but not oily despite the high abv of 12%. This is enhanced with a lower carbonation level. The taste becomes more bitter with a coffee ground flavor coming through in the swallow. Long bitter Baker's chocolate aftertaste.",4.09

Aromas of sweet chocolate and roasted malts. 
 
A delicious mix of sweet chocolate, coffee, caramel-like toffee and deep roasted malts. All the flavors meld together for a nearly perfect imperial stout. The 12% ABV is well hidden but you’ll need to respect it and take your time sipping this brew. 
 
A creamy, heavier consistency. Low to moderate carbonation. Leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste.

Attack: Omigoodness — dark roast following the nose; coffee, toffee, chocolate. 
 
Finish: Alcohol, roast bitterness to balance the attack. 
 
This is the epitome of an Imperial Stout. Totally deserves its world-class rating. So well balanced! Flavorful, drinkable, though I enjoy it as a sipper. There’s no beer I’d rather pair with a rich chocolate dessert, though today it’s doing just fine with mixed, lightly salted nuts.",4.66
Speedway Stout,"This is an ABV bomb at 12%. The look in a glass is quite lovely with a dark body and (thin) head. The smell is of strong coffee together with an almost bourbon or rye smell, most likely due to the high alcohol level. The taste is strong and close to syrupy.

Overall: I love this beer. I was fortunate enough to try several Bell’s beers years ago when they first tried breaking into the Oregon market and always had a soft spot for this, so was an easy purchase when I saw it locally again.

Speedway Stout,"Received in a proxy/trade hybrid from @turkeysdrinkbeer in February 2022. Drunk in November of that year. 
 
L: A very thin, caramel-coloured head sits atop an inky, black glass of thick-looking, dead-still beer. No light penetrates the veil and no carbonation is visible.  
 
S: The nose has roasted chocolate and coffee beans. Rich, gooey toffee sits beneath.  
 
T: The first thing to note is the absolute lack of booze on the palate. There's none present on the way down and no sting on the tongue. I suspect this beer hides its weapons in plain sight. I don't see them yet, and I don't feel them now, but when they kick in I'm going to wonder what hit me. 
 
Tastewise, there's coffee, but it's quite subtle. There's a layer of milky chocolate and, as I always perceive in stouts these days, a raspberry and cola note. There's some residual sweetness after the swallow that stops me from crushing what would otherwise be a reasonably quick-drinking beer. 
 
The ability of this beer to hide its 12% gives it extra marks.  
 
M: The beer is smooth and oily on the mouth but there's the slightest thinness that I think comes from the lack of booze in the flavour.  
 
O: With mouthfeel being the only knock on this beer, it's an extremely enjoyable drink. The sweetness never gets cloying and the booze never gets uncomfortable. I wouldn't want more than one, but that's ok in the case of this beer as I'd regret two of these the next day! 
 
Cheers!

Speedway Stout,"Notes from 6/19/2022. 
Poured from a 16oz can into a snifter. 
The beer is jet black with a small head that quickly dissipates to a thin cap. 
The intensity of aroma is medium. The aroma has dark chocolate, strong cold brewed coffee, and maybe a hint of cinnamon. There's a slight sweetness in the aroma. 
The intensity of taste is high. The flavor has strong dark coffee and dark chocolate that are so well balanced that they quickly fluctuate. The underlying maltiness is sweet, the hops are spicy and are both in balance with the coffee and chocolate flavors.  
The thickness is, well, thick. It's a little slick, very creamy, and the astringency is medium and in balance with the carbonation which is slightly above low. 
Overall, the balance of flavors and the balance of elements in the mouth feel is masterful. I like that the intensity of aroma is moderate and it made me unprepared for how very strong the flavor is. It's a world class imperial stout that I anticipate getting again.",4.54

Union Jack IPA,"Pours a clear orange-yellow, frothy 0.5"" of head that settles to a thick collar of foam. Nose is spicy, piney, resinous hop and a fair amount of malt sweetness for balance.

It's really solid and reliable.",4.03

I consider this a nice decent average mass produced witbier.",3.46
Blue Moon Belgian White,"24 oz can acclimated to 48°F and poured into a tulip glass. 
 
Pours hazy, the color of apricot juice, nice color. Produces a 1 finger white head, dissipating quickly and leaving lacing that fades quickly. 
 
Initial aroma is orange peel and juice with some yeast, slight note of hay maybe? After agitating I'm hit with a funky and cooling smell that reminds me of sea spray. 
 
Initial taste before swallowing feels like it hits the same receptors as salt, it's juicy and yeasty with a peachy and apricot taste. After swallowing I first taste a peachy/fruity/nectar/juicy taste. I then notice a fermented/bread/dough/yeast taste that seems to grow in intensity when the other tastes fade. In the aftertaste is a bitterness that I don't find pleasant, sort of a rotten vegetable taste. 
 
Mouthfeel is rather juicy, feeling heavy, and somewhat sticky, but not syrupy. Dare I say, silky. It's the proper descriptor, but implies a little higher quality than I'd call it. 
 
Overall it's good for the price. It's not amazing and it's not got many layers of flavor, but it satisfied me well enough. I did enjoy the yeasty bread taste quite a bit, and the mouthfeel was impressive. Would be a decent session beer if kept at the recommended temperature and not allowed to warm too much. 
 
Not likely to buy again, I've had it in the past but wanted to try again, maybe in several years like I did this time. I might, but whatever.",3.73

Bigfoot,"A 2023 iteration bottled on January 12, 2023 and poured into a tulip about five months later. 
 
Pours dark/amber brown. Excellent head. Initially, it releases big bubbles from the bottom of the pour that slowly bubble up. Good retention and lacing.  
 
Aromas of dark fruit and piney hops, along with some modest citrus.  
 
The brew delivers initial sticky-bready caramel-malt sweetness balanced almost immediately by white pepper and pine hoppiness. As the brew warms, a distinct grapefruit citrus note rounds out the middle, along with raisin, peach, and molasses. Some anise, tobacco and leather are trying to manifest, but need some time to mature. Not as boozy as feared. There are quite a few different things going on here.  
 
Full bodied for sure, it nevertheless is very drying and tingly, which makes each sip welcome. 
 
Overall, I understand why this brew can be polarizing, because there is nothing subtle or nuanced about a newer bottle of this brew. Regardless, this is a very flavorful American Barleywine that is excellent, but would probably be better with a little more age to smooth things out from what is currently pretty wild.",3.91
Bigfoot,"This one appeared in our local grocery rural Montana grocery store and and I thought it worth a try. Up front, I'll admit that the word ""Barleywine"" grabbed my eye and I missed the word, ""Style"". While after buying the first sixpack for (at our store) a very reasonable price of $11.50 I then came back for the other four, I liked it very much for what it was, not what it purported to be. If you are looking for a Barleywine, this isn't it. If instead, you are looking for an very excellent dark imperial IPA this is the one! Hops to spare and definitely a worthwhile pint to keep in your stock. If this sounds like it works for you then by all means grab some. I am glad I found it.",4.15

Smell - woody, malty, piney, floral, spicy 
Taste - toasted malt, sweet caramel, hoppy, black pepper, piney, citrus 
Feel - medium body and carbonation, sticky piney resinous finish, peppery 
Overall - My first Barleywine and I'm very impressed. There is some serious hop nectar going on here. Flavor is very rich, almost like you're drinking the hops extract concentrate straight from the can and the enormous malt body brings the balance of toasted malt and a bit of sweet caramel. This brew is right up my alley with intense hoppy, piney, bitter traits that linger after every sip. Originally I bought one to try and that turned into buying a couple of six packs after I did try it. I'm gonna save a few to age and drink them in the years to come. Bigfoot is definitely a beast so take your time and pair it with the long classic, Do You Feel Like We Do from the Frampton Comes Alive! album. Enjoy!",4.81

Dale's Pale Ale,"Acclimated to 50°F and poured into an American pint glass. 
 
Pours a clear, dark dark gold, maybe bronze, with a 2 finger foamy lasting white head with heavy and sturdy lacing. 
 
whiffs of hop and marijuana while looking. Initial aroma is lightly hoppy with a slight marijuana/skunk presence. Smells slightly watery or diluted, with notes of grapefruit pith/rind. Smells almost sanitary somehow? The marijuana note and diluted feeling fade after smelling a while, and the grapefruit becomes stronger. After agitating the hops become stronger. 
 
Initial taste before swallowing is sweet, bitter, and slightly dank with grapefruit rind and caramel like maltiness. After swallowing, the grapefruit rind becomes a full on grapefruit oil taste that lasts into the aftertaste along with the sweet maltiness, sitting on the middle top and sides of the tongue. The hops manifest on the swallow, bright and dry. A black pepper kick is revealed in the roof of the mouth in the late aftertaste, and a vague pine taste can be found throughout. The bitterness builds as I drink. It felt to me as though the flavors were were a little disjointed, though that's likely entirely personal preference, they worked alright. 
 
Mouthfeel is slightly creamy and smooth, which is enjoyable. It goes down easy, sort of crashing around the mouth.

Smell - woody earthy hops, floral, malty 
Taste - sweet malty, floral, citrus, pine sappy aftertaste 
Feel - medium light body, low carbonation, pine resinous finish 
Overall - Wow! I remember the first time I had this and today I have the same thought. Can't believe this is a pale ale. It drinks like a west coast IPA with the pine sappy aftertaste and pine resinous finish. I know there's thousands of options out there today but don't sleep on this one. Pick it up if you've never tried it or pick it up again if you have. Dale's is a classic tasty brew that I will enjoy again and again. Pairs up nicely with Back for More by Ratt.",4.02
Dale's Pale Ale,"Picked up some of these on St. Patrick's Day to try for Half & Halfs. Decided to try one again today on its own. 
 
L: Pours a rich copper with a 3 finger, almost creamy, beige head with excellent retention. Leaves nice lacing and when the head finally dissipates, it leaves a thick, beige cap. A little dark for the style, but otherwise gorgeous. 
 
S: Fairly simple, yet quite pleasing. Sweet malt and grapefruit/floral notes from the hops. 
 
T: Flavors follow the nose, but the sweet is toned down a bit by the hop bitterness, which is welcomed for this style of beer. This really combines nicely into a pretty nice session beer. 
 
F: Ample carbonation, pretty crisp and finishes extra dry. Good for sessions, but you may need some water on hand to combat the dry mouth. 
 
O: Pretty solid beer overall. My Main gripe with this beer is the extra dry finish. While I am a fan of beers with a semi-dry or even dry finish, depending on style, this one is just a bit too much for me. Was decent for Half & Halfs (the hop bitterness was actually a little too forward). This Pale Ale definitely tows the line of IPA, but is an interesting take on an American Pale Ale.",3.82

The Abyss,"Drinking a 2018 bottle (cellared). This RIS has a roasted malt or grain characteristic which sets it apart from some of the others. It is not a sweet beer with lots of cherries, plums, or fruits. Rather, it is a dry, dark and burnt character leaning towards tart/bitter end of the scale for me. It is like a dry RIS. I like it. More of the bitter Chocolate and Coffee end of the spectrum. It is mellow, and not boozy (for me). Mouth feel is medium, and not too chewy. Just right actually. Looks like motor oil from an old V8 that has not been drained in 20k miles. Reaching for my 2nd one just now. This is a quality product from Deschutes.",4.34

I suspect that the wax over the bottle cap along with the hefty ABV helped. Pours jet black with a frothy coffee colored head. Some slight hints of this beers age come through in the nose, but not enough to be offensive. As many other reviews state, there is a lot going on in this offering. Every sip offers up a new flavor or aroma that I did not pick out in the previous. The barrel aged flavor complements this beer instead of overpowering it. The nose is the only hint that this beer has just over 5 years on it. Overall, an enjoyable and complex imperial stout.",4.28

Aroma is mainly malty with overtones of cereal grain and grapefruit. Taste is bitter throughout but very well balanced with the malty sweetness and spicy alcohol flavor on the follow through. The bitterness lingers with creamy thickness in the mouth for this medium to full bodied brew. There is even a nice carbonation tingle on the tongue.

A closer sniff said something closer to overripe bananas foster with a hint of nutmeg. Nutmeg comes up first from a fairly rough mouth feel, then something boozy and a little dry that overpowers any fruitiness.

Pumking,"Light caramel in color with a slightly white head. Can't discern too much immediate pumpkin notes that makes me think this is pumpkin pie in a glass. Definitely some enjoyable cereal grain malt notes. It comes off as fairly boozy and at 8.6% it definitely is.  
I think this is a good beer but it's not ""pumpkin pie in a glass"" as advertised. Clove, some nutmeg, but lots of cereal grains and intermeshed bitter notes. I'm not sure what's going on because a lot of reviews are saying this tastes extremely pumpkin pie like and others are decrying it as being watered down. I'm definitely in the latter camp because this is coming up pretty short in the sweet pumpkin pie regard. It is a good and strong imperial beer but comes off closer to a barleywine than a pumpkin ale. Frankly there might be some quality control issues somewhere in the manufacturing or supply chain that are creating such a variance in assessments of this beer.",3.66

Smell:  
Dark, bittersweet chocolate and coffee. Char. Molasses. Anise. Caramelized and somewhat burnt sugar. A fair amount of earth. 
 
Taste:

Feel:  
Silky and mouth-coating. A nice warmth from the alcohol. The body is only a shade or 2 lighter than full.

An excellent (Russian) Imperial Stout. One of my favorites of the style. I buy it when I see it. Which last was in 2019.

Spicy barley notes as well which give it some more savory notes that help prevent this from becoming too sweet. Light bitterness comes through long on the finish.

Feels good. Medium body, not light at all, but not heavy. Not much carbonation sting. A little on the top at the front, but it fades before the swallow.  
 
Overall: good, if you want to drink unsweetened cocoa and get a buzz.",3.26
Porter,"Very dark, black coffee color with ruby highlights, moderate but lasting milk chocolate colored creamy head and some decent lacing.  
The aroma is dark roasted malt, coffee, burnt toast, dark chocolate, some hints of caramel and vanilla.  
The taste is all of that, with a bit more emphasis on the burnt toast and dark roast coffee, giving a pleasant bitterness.  
The body is medium/full, moderate carbonation, creamy smooth, very drinkable and inviting. Altogether, this is an outstanding example of a robust porter, incredibly smooth, moderate bitterness, very enjoyable, even better as it warms up a little.",4.28

Porter,"Not had in a few years - this is a classic done right. 
Pours just short of black with a finger of creamy tan coloured head.

Porter,"Had on tap at Bulldog Saloon Lynnwood, WA",4.14
Porter,"APPEARANCE 
Absolutely black out. Pitch black in all regards with no red or brown on the edges. The pour produced a hefty three fingers of off-white head. 
 
AROMA 
Lots of roast and I mean A LOT. It's like a cup of coffee though I don't think it is specifically brewed with any coffee. I get some sweet caramel notes and even some vanilla. A good hint of chocolate syrup rounds out what is turning into a decadent dessert beer.  
 
TASTE 
I tell ya that roast from the aroma is singing just as loud and proud here on the taste. It's bordering on burnt coffee, but is reeled in just enough where it is just dark roast. With that comes a big blast of bitterness, but it is quite pleasant. My next swig just got me a ton of that chocolate syrup which brings us right back to dessert beer territory. Subtle caramel notes in the front and the end is more of that coffee bitterness. 
 
MOUTHFEEL 
Not too thick, but not watered down. Very smooth and velvety as the brewer's description prepared me for. Despite all that coffee bitterness it is a pleasure to drink and it doesn't leave behind a sticky film despite all the sweet flavors. 
 
OVERALL 
Lives up to its reputation and then some. It's a robust porter at a reasonable ABV and is available year round. A winner in all aspects.",4.34
Porter,"A fairly straightforward brew. Not as sweet or milky as I expected from the nose. Expresso, dark chocolate, hoppy bitterness, I get the graham cracker, and faint sweetness. Taste is rich and unfortunately mouthfeel lacks silkiness to support that.

Off the bottle I get some dark and roasty coffee but accompanied by a fair bit of sweetness too. Off the glass I pick up the same but the sweetness gives off a bit of char and a bigger dose of roasted malts. 4.5

West Coast IPA,"Only photos could describe the foamy white mess that rises above the top of a clear glass liter mug. It’s that pathetic. Really, no beer pour, especially an IPA should ever have this much stark white starchy foam pretending to be a head. This is the consequence of trying to fit two twelve ounce cans' contents into the vessel. With patience, the foam recedes and there becomes almost a true beer head. Obviously, there are concerns, as big white foamy and starchy heads often lead to taste and mouthfeel disappointments. The aroma is of OK piney hoppiness; but, so far, it's looks over aroma and looks have a big negative lead. The color isn't the problem. It's a rich and bright dark amber that's close to being translucent. Actually, it's a pretty good looking brew once the head recedes. Much as expected, this is a nicely West Coast hopped rendition, without much of a malt inclusion to carry it via its body, nor to give it a counterbalance so necessary for a great IPA. The ratings here may be inconsistent, but that sums up the brew. There's good color, but bad lacing. There's a nice sharp piney hop bite, but no malt balance, nor backbone. This isn't bad and the tastes of those that want hoppiness, even at the expense of a malty presence, will like this. To taste, it's a nicely dry hopped ale. To anyone that loves a traditional IPA, the lack of barley malt in the mix will spoil this.",4.02
West Coast IPA,"Slightly hazy, rich amber appearance with a generous, fine bubbled head that left rings of good lacing.

Bleue (Blue),"I love Belgian beers and this one is my favorite! A pure masterclass on what a Belgian beer should be. Rochefort 8 is close, but Chimay Blue is the standard of excellence.

Bleue (Blue),,4.25
Bleue (Blue),"So, this review may not be wholly representative.  
 
2000 bottle of Chimay Blue plucked from the depths of Cafe Kulminator by Leen.  
 
Bottle is appropriately dusty and the cap is scratched, but fully intact including the seal beneath.  
 
The beer pour a deep burgundy red almost impenetrable by the lighting here It js still clear and clean.  
 
The bottom of the bottle has a ring of sediment that goes unmoved even as the bottle is tilted past 90 degrees to the horizontal. Amazing.  
 
Carbonation is still full, but very soft. A thin 1/3” head persisted until my first taste. It can be regenerated with swirling.  
 
Nose is that off a well aged beer: lots of malt with a hint of wet basement. Light floral notes persist.  
 
This beer is amazingly smooth. Everything blends together well and there’s bo hint of the ABV. Malt and Belgian yeast dominate. This is from before the time when Chimay changed out their fermenters.  
 
Compared to a fresh bottle, this is something else entirely. They are related, but distinctly different; a testament to Dirk and Leen’s care and attention.  
 
There are few places that revere Chimay like Kulminator. You would do well to visit and try some. Better yet, come with a small group (3) and try a multi-decade vertical.

Guinness Draught,"Appearance: Served from both a 14.9 nitro can and, more impressively, a tap/keg poured into a chilled Guinness pint glass. The tap/keg service, in particular, accentuates the beer's visual appeal. It presents an even more impressive creamy head that intriguingly billows down to the bottom of the glass, a spectacle that is delightfully captivating. After a 90 second wait, the drinking begins. Whether from the can or tap, the beverage exhibits heavy lacing and a long-lasting head. However, the visual drama of the pour is distinctly amplified when served from the tap. 
 
Scent: The nose is greeted by the aromas of roasted barley and coffee. 
 
Taste: The flavor profile carries over the scents of roasted barley and coffee, but also introduces notes of chocolate, fruity yeast, and a gentle hop presence to maintain freshness. Though not complex, it is extremely well-balanced. Despite a low grain bill, the fruitiness of the yeast and the smoothness provided by the nitro infusion alleviate any harshness from the roasted barley. The beer is surprisingly easy to drink. 
 
Mouthfeel: The upfront creaminess from the nitro-infused head contrasts nicely with the light and slightly watery texture due to the low grain bill. This brew is easy to drink, refreshingly light, and quite popular in warm-climate countries. 
 
Overall: This is a well-crafted light stout that is not only refreshing but also sessionable. It has become my go-to beer for St. Patrick's Day and beyond, given the nitro's gentleness on the lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Indeed, Guinness seems to be onto something - I might start finishing some of my homebrews on nitro. 
 
This light stout's low grain profile can lead to variable harshness of flavor if not consumed fresh. Guinness on Tap/Keg presents a superior taste and creamier feel, featuring the nitro/carbonation twang without the excess harshness of the roasted barley, which can come off as an ""ashtray"" taste in cans. Think of it like the difference between freshly brewed coffee (on tap) and coffee that's been sitting on heat for a while (cans). 
 
Overall scores: 
Nitro Can: 3.25 
On Tap/Keg: 4.00",3.77
Duvel,"I've been drinking Duvel for years and its an awesome beer. I do have a few observations that I'd like to share. First, it has always had a bit of an astringent (acidic) bitterness on the finish that i don't love compared to other Belgian strong ales. I've noticed that acidity tends to calm down a bit if you drink it a bit warmer at cellar temp. This makes a big difference to me. Still a world class beer without question and one of the best beer glasses in the industry IMHO.",4.03

120 Minute IPA,"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. 2017 vintage, 5 years old.  
 
A: The most vigorous pour I could muster did not turn up any head. Deep brown in color with good clarity. I half expected sediment, but there really isn't any. Not much in the way of lacing either. A few tiny specs. 
 
S: A lot of raw honey, apricot, malty aromas of fig jam and a pop of berry. Highly estery with pineapple/tropical notes. Orange marmalade complete with peels. Earthy and leafy notes with that aged ""forest floor"" character. Treacle and a hint of toast/crust.  
 
T: Follows the nose. Lots of raw honey up front, figs and berries, richer malty notes of molasses and toasted crust and scones. Very tropical and estery- big notes of pineapple, starfruit, papaya. Orange marmalade. Hit of warming alcohol. Downright spicy with herbal oiliness. Earthy and leafy. Dose of ""musty book"" and nutty sherry oxidation. Aggressive spicy/oily hop finish with trailing alcohol heat and figgy malt.  
 
M: very thick with a ton of coating residual sugar. It is syrupy in texture. Good pressing sense of weight. Carbonation is fading, but there's still some fine pricking around the tip of the tongue. Gritty hop astringency.  
 
O: This beer becomes very interesting with age. It might be an acquired taste for those who prefer IPAs fresh, though. It becomes a three way brawl between a brawny malt character, aggressively estery alcohol, and a good dose of oily/spicy hops. Age has deepened that malt into a lot of fruity complexity, brought out more earthy ""forest floor"" hop notes, and a lot of musty and sherry-like oxidation. It's also hot and a bit much when fresh though. Something like 1-3 years of age may be the sweet spot for me I think, but it comes down to preferences. It certainly isn't bad now.",4

120 Minute IPA,"Got a couple of bottles of this as an x-mas gift. Bottle's a year or two old, this is the 2021 release. Poured into pint glass. 
Pours a dark, rich copper tone. The short off-white head dissipates quickly, but leaves a nice ring and dense lacing. Smells a little like apple cider. I take a sip. Malt! Malt, and it's punching me in the face. Much maltier than it is hoppy- a logical progression from the 90 Minute IPA, which holds the two in balance. I wasn't sure I liked it until I kept drinking and decided I definitely do. Very sweet. Brings a caramel apple to mind, and then you get piney notes on the back end to remind you you're drinking an IPA. A little alcoholic, which works here. I wouldn't mind it being more bitter. Perfectly carbonated with a full body.  
It's a strange IPA. A prior reviewer said it reminded them of a barleywine, which does track. Another reviewer said it's not an IPA, and I'm not sure I'm equipped to argue with them. I'm not sure what it is, though, other than Very Good.

Pours a dark copper, like dark apple cider. Opaque. Small brown head that dissipated quickly leaving a collar. 
 
Aroma of malt, dark fruit, mild alcohol, dark sugar, spice and somewhat herbal. 
 
Taste is dark fruit, alcohol [but not overpowering], apples, prunes, caramel, bread, bitter orange, dates and pine. 
 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied and cleansing. Nicely smooth in the mouth.

It does taste sweet, more sweet than bitter. The bitterness is slighty, lingering around a slight alcohol taste. I think it's like butterscotch and caramel up front. It's a little fruity, definitely along the barleywine track. Fairly thick, syrupy, easy to drink but warming. Moderately carbonated and somewhat dry. Very interesting. 
 
I would love to do a vertical taste test. The last time I had this was in... 2019! At a tasting event that also served Utopias. It's powerful. I'm really out of the race at this point.",4.28

Racer 5,"I rated this great West Coast IPA years ago with a rating over 4.4 under a now lost username. I have some bad news about my favorite Northern California IPA. 
Bear Republic Brewing Co. of Cloverdale, California was acquired by Drake's Brewing Co. of San Leandro, California early in 2023. Newspaper stories of the time stated that Drake's would be brewing Racer 5 again from their brewery in San Leandro. Drake's acquired all of the Bear Republic intellectual property including recipes, trademarks and packaging rights. 
Well, that was the story, at least. 
I was a purchaser of Racer 5 in 12-pack bottles. The cardboard boxes stated that it was brewed in Sonoma County. On June 12 of 2023 I purchased what I believed to be Bear Republic Racer 5 IPA. This cardboard box claimed Racer 5 was brewed in San Jose with a bottling date of May 11, 2023. The brew contained in these bottles was not the same Racer 5 that I dearly loved. The substantial layer of brewer's yeast at the bottom of each bottle was gone, meaning that this brew was no longer a genuine bottle-conditioned IPA. The head was gone. Carbonation was nearly flat. The full-bodied ""IPA"" was now thin and watered down like any cheap canned ""IPA."" Odd smell and off-taste. The complex hops profile was absent and now tasted suspiciously of Citra or Galaxy. I made a call to Drake's and they told me that Racer 5 was now brewed by Gordon Biersch of San Jose. They assured me that when Drake's started production of Racer 5 the boxes would be marked as brewed in San Leandro. 
That's the miserable end of Racer 5 for me. I will watch for future production of Racer 5 from San Leandro should that actually happen. Sorry to be the bearer (no pun intended) of bad news.",1.41
Racer 5,"Aroma was malty and slightly piney, medium carb, two finger head. Taste - very malty, bready and thick with butterscotch notes. Lots of sticky piney hop bittering. Not sure how this differs from a New England IPA but nonetheless it ain't no West Coast IPA despite the fact it's brewed on the West Coast. So I guess for the style is right on. This is a classic IPA from Bear Republic so definitely a must try if you're an IPA connoissieur.",3.65

Racer 5,"Pours a delightful hazy orange with a voluminous off-white head that lasts, giving epic lacing. 
Smell is sweet caramel, oranges, apricots, and slight honeydew. 
Taste follows the smell nicely with no off flavors. A bit less honeydew in the taste, and a bit more apricot and orange. Sweet, or perhaps semi-sweet... Malt-forward, but still quite hoppy with a lasting bitter finish. 
Feel is very smooth and full-bodied; carbonation is moderate and just right for this style. ABV is there, but not pressing. 
Overall, an under-rated, old-school, west-coast IPA that is a must try for all die-hard IPA lovers.",5

Racer 5,"Poured from an unfortunately undated 16oz can 
 
On the first pour an insane four finger head formed. Pretty good retention too, as it took me 6ish minutes to pour the whole pint into a Spieglau IPA glass. After pouring I had a stiff rocky white sudsy head that left foamy lacing. Body is a hazy golden yellow. 
 
Aroma comes off as sweet, in a big beer sense, but is immediately followed by big resiny hops with rhindy citrus notes in the back. Like if pine sap was lemon scented? Super hoppy but in a fresh herbal way. A touch of ""ale"" character in the way back. 
 
Flavor is smooth and drinkable with a wave of bitterness. Tasting notes mostly follow the aroma, but the sweetness dissapears completely, due to the bitterness. Full flavor implies a maltiness, but the hops cover up any true malt character, as typical for the style. Lemony pine resin with a dry malt insinuating finish is the main experience. 
 
Feel is drinkable verging on dangerous for the ABV. Very easy to drink and quite smooth, although the finish is quite dry and bitter. The dryness begins verging on astringency, and I'm unsure if that is due to hopping rates, or something else. Very full with a medium long finish. 
 
Overall this is a decent legacy IPA. It's super drinkable, very ""beery"" and pretty enjoyable. Bright herbal citric and overall hoppy, this is what I thought an IPA tasted like when my mom explained hops to me as a kid, and I still didn't appreciate beer. Classic old school IPA, this is what a WCIPA should be IMO.",3.86

Aroma of bready malt, floral with touch of pine and big swath of orange, tangerine and tropical fruit - underwhelming at first but popped as warmed just a touch (this is on me!). 
Tastes an explosion of hops - citrus, a bit of pine, fruity with notes of mango, tangerine; certainly a floral presence and a bright spicy bitterness that coats the palate balanced by bready caramel malt sweetness. 
Medium full mouthfeel with a coating bittersweetness that lingers nicely. 
This is a classic for a reason and on a short list of ""desert island"" beers.",4.49

Bleue (Blue),June 2023. Hartwell. Always a solid beer.,4.51
Bleue (Blue),"Pours a deep, dark brown with a 2"" toasted marshmallow head that has serious retention and lacing. Nose is sweet raisin, baked brown bread, clove and baking spice, toasted brown sugar and molasses, apple cider, gingerbread. Unlike many in the style, the raisin notes isn't overly sweet or treacly, but instead is very well balanced. Taste is similarly balanced - dark fruit (prunes, dark cherries), pumpernickel bread, and a surprising amount of earthy hop. The hop element keeps things from becoming overly sweet, and as a result, its surprisingly drinkable at 9%. There is a big alcohol kick on the palate, but it isn't overwhelming. Finish is more hop, keeping things pretty tannic, and some grassiness. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side for the ABV and with small, champagne-like carbonation.",4.38

Duvel,"Re reviewing, after more beer drinking experience. All Duvel creations will always get a 5 for appearance. 
 
Aroma is a little musky and fizzy malt, almost some banana like a wheat beer. Not my favourite aroma, I prefer more hops. 
 
Taste is much much better than the aroma. So much yeastiness and different flavours and aromas. This is unpasteurized for sure. Pasteurization destroys every beer. Bitterness dominates, followed by a foamy hit that explodes on the tongue and wriggles down the throat, into the stomach. You can feel it as it continues it's journey. 
 
The taste relies primarily on malt, without that much noticeble hops. It has a slight hint of being overtly fermented. A feeling that you will have a really bad headache the next day. Other beers don't give me this feeling. I would not want to drink this every day. Where as a West Coast IPA, I would be happy to drink 10 a day. If I could find 10 a day. 
 
I much prefer the Equinox, but it's still good. But it's not as good as many West Coast IPA's or even a Chouffe IPA. This doesn't come close. It's one of the best commercial beers in the world for sure. But it needs more hops ; )",3.51
120 Minute IPA,"This is in no way an ""ipa"". It's false advertisement and a horrible beer product for $11-12 per bottle. It's all hype/gimmick. It's not satisfying at all. It's over the top in the worst way. Should be discontinued.",1

120 Minute IPA,"There is no rational reason to have more than one of these per occasion. So, one brown twelve ounce bottle has been emptied into a clear pint glass. Almost no head was produced and it vanished almost instantaneously. Forget about the head, because the brew is beautiful, anyway. It's bright copper-amber and it's on the translucent side. Malt is the predominant smell, with hints of alcohol and hops. Of course, there's an alcoholic aspect to the taste that's too big to ignore. After all, the ABV here is an incredible 18 percent. Considering that, this tastes so much better than some that are less potent, but taste like a shot of whisky was dropped into the beer. This is malty in the Scottish Ale way, sweetly and with a kick. The hops are there for some counterbalance and they add an enjoyable extra layer of taste. But, this is malt and alcohol driven. It's good for what it is, an attempt at making an incredibly high ABV brew that tastes good. To that point, this is a success, for others in this range almost never taste this good. But for most beer drinkers, even those that can enjoy an Imperial IPA or stout in the 8-10% ABV range, this is a little much. There reaches a point when this much alcohol reduces the beer drinking experience and this might be it.",4.15

Imperial Russian Stout,"Stone Imperial Russian Stout pours a deep, dark black, with a 2 finger dark tan head perched above. nicely carbonated and beautifully laced, this beer is a visual treat for stout lovers. As bold as the beer looks, the nose is surprisingly muted, but I do detect coffee, chocolate, and malt in equal measure, which is reassuring. The taste is bounces right back to the boldness of the look, and is complex. Coffee, chocolate and malt notes are there, but hops push right in. This is one of the hoppiest imperial Russian stouts I have ever had, and I find that amazingly appealing. As you swallow, a fully rounded sweet aftertaste arises... bold, like molasses. This brews' balancing act of coffee, chocolate, malt, hops, and molasses is artfully composed, and unique. Each flavor stands out, and taken as a whole, this is a fascinating brew. I have been wondering for a decade why everyone speaks lovingly of Stone Imperial Russian Stout, and now that I have tried it, I believe the rave reviews I have read are all fully justified. What can I say? I WILL be stocking up!",4.4
Imperial Russian Stout,"A jet black pour produces a deep tan, creamy head. Lacing is streams and spots with varying stickiness. Feel is pretty aggressively bitter, fitting in with Stone's reputation but it has the effect of roughing up the nearly full body of the beer for me. Aromas open with chocolate and coffee emphasized in the dark malts, with the piney hops starting to play in as the beer warms up. Bitterness is up front in the taste, seeming at first coming from the hops, but the roasted notes of coffee, hiagh-cacao dark choclate, and even a little campfire ember combine and take over by mid-taste. Carbonation level is nice, keeping the dark malt richness from weighing down each sip too much.",4.31

Imperial Russian Stout,"Can. Certainly fits promotional description and some of the recent reviews. Very dark, black, lots of head, dry bitter chocolate and coffee taste. One reviewer compared it to soy sauce which I can see. Apparently a top selection of this style which I don’t seem to resonate to. My ratings reflect my preferences, would omit if I could. I think I like sweeter stouts like Oatmeal Stout better, and those with caramel notes or less bitterness.",3.53
Imperial Russian Stout,"Pours black with a little head. The aroma is dark malts, maybe some vanilla and hops. The taste is citrus hops, dark malts, licorice, some bitterness with a little bit of vanilla and a tad bit like soy sauce. This is an OK stout but drinks somewhat like a strong black ipa and I’d just prefer having one of those over this. Now the Espresso IRS was something special but this is a one and doner and I did have a higher opinion when I had it a few years back but many good stouts later my palette has probably shifted as it has with other beers as well, cheers!",3.81
Nugget Nectar,"Outstanding! Highly recommend! Received as a gift, going to get more!",5
Nugget Nectar,"Dark copper-amber, but bright and almost translucent, a clear pint glass full of it reveals. There's virtually no head to describe, but that's the Philly style of serving draft beers. Even without a head, it's a lovely beer. Little aroma rises above the glass, a little malt a little hops and no discernable alcohol. This is one of those that doesn't offer much to the nose, but gives the tongue a workout. Quickly, it's learned that regardless of the word ""nectar"" in its name, this isn't some sort of overly sweetened ale. There is some sweetness provided by ample malting, but this one bites. There's just the right dose of alcohol in the mix that it amplifies the sharp hoppiness, which is noteworthy. With notes of pine and citrus, this is a bitterly hopped brew (a good thing) that brings so much more character than most in this style. The glass lacing is a little short. So, this isn't one for the nose and maybe not long for the eyes. It is a complex hopfest within a solid malted body.",4.26
Nugget Nectar,"Rare 5 out 5. Looking for balanced And if so high marks it will receive. No hop bomb but you can taste the some of the ""excessively dry hopped,"" But sage quickly to a malt creamy goodness. If you're looking for a hop slinger move on but if you're looking for great tasting grab it whem you can. Cheers!",5
Nugget Nectar,"16oz can purchased from the fridge as a single from a local bottle shop for $4.55. ""Freshest by 04/28/2023""....given that this was released pretty recently (January 10th), I would say that this beer is less than one month old. 
 
Look: Pours a clear medium amber color with a tan-colored head that slowly dissipated to a very thin layer. Looks very nice. 
 
Smell: Very nice aromas of fresh hops - earthy, resinous pine along with some dankness, woody notes, and grapefruit notes. There's a bit of caramel sweetness underneath all of that hop aroma. This beer smells a bit like a slightly stronger version of Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale. 
 
Taste: It's surprisingly balanced, refreshing, and drinkable. Up front, it has a very nice maltiness with the caramel notes coming through briefly before being taken over by hops. The finish is actually not nearly as bitter as I was expecting; it's relatively smooth and has a pleasant long-lingering bitterness that is not very intense. Nice grapefruit rind flavors on the finish also. 
 
Feel: The mouthfeel is a bit chewy. Nicely carbonated. Medium plus body. 
 
Overall: This beer brings back memories. The first time I had this beer was in the mid- to late- 2000s in Atlanta. Someone had acquired this beer in a trade (I think) and brought it to a beer share. I was blown away by this beer. There aren't many other Imperial Red Ales out there. One that I used to consume a lot of was Terrapin's Big Hoppy Monster. Fast forward to living in PA: I moved here just over 10 years ago. It was probably 9 years ago when I made a feeble attempt to procure some Nugget Nectar. I called a beer distributor that I passed on my way to work and at that time the state laws only allowed them to sell entire cases. I wasn't able to buy/consume that much beer so I passed. Hard to believe that it's been over 15 years since I have had this beer! Enough with story time. This beer certainly deserves its #1 ranking among Imperial Red Ales.

Appearance: Pours a completely dark, black color with a massive dark tan head. SRM of 23-24. (4.25) 
 
Aroma: Strong aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, some bitter coffee roast underneath. Somewhat dry. 
 
Flavor: Strong and rich flavors of dark chocolate, cocoa, some vanilla, dark fruit, light espresso roast. Yeasty in the middle and ultimately finishes with lingering dark chocolate notes. 
 
Feel: Medium-bodied, strong carbonation. Somewhat clean on the palate. Surprisingly dry. 
 
Compared to Sierra Nevada Narwal 2/2023: Pours similar with a larger head. Milder aromas. More dark chocolate and roast. Less pine. More of a roasty bitterness with less pine. 
 
Compared to North Coast Old Rasputin 3/2023: Pours similar, darker head. Stronger aromas. More Dark chocolate, and bitter pine. Less bittersweet chocolate, English black malt and cream. Darker, heavier, and more bitter pine.  
 
Overall: A very-well made Russian Imperial Stout. Dark chocolate, coffee roast, yeasty, yet incredibly dry and drinkable. The drinkability and dryness is the key here and how it hides the alcohol.

Continuing with stouts, I chose this from Prairie. Using my Jester tulip glass, I let the beer warm up to 56 degrees. A hard pour created a half finger, medium dark tan head. The retention is dismal, and dropped as fast as it formed. The color of the beer charts arounds SRM 36, dark brown with ruby hues. The beer is opaque but does show some carbonation bubbles on the sides of the glass. Overall the appearance is average for this style, I wanted to see a longer lasting head.  
 
Nosing the beer, I detect dark chocolate, vanilla, coconut with espresso. After smelling the beer several more times, I notice caramel, bourbon, oak, hints of floral, dates, raisins, slight char, roasted malts, bready, and a touch of Maillard.  
 
The chocolate weaves coconut with vanilla seamlessly. Other flavors in the beer are caramel, bready, roasted maltiness, raisins, figs, oak, bourbon, oak, anise, soy sauce, oranges, hints of floral, Maillard, and char.  
 
The heavy roasted malts gives the beer a heavy body and a low carbonation. A chewy thick mouthfeel and a lasting finish.

Smell: Resounding, rich dark maltiness infused with cinnamon-vanilla infused sugar, (subtler) coffee, chocolate powder, German dark bread, dark syrup, dark fruits (all tings dark, really). 
 
Taste: Sweetish dark maltiness of toasted black bread, rounded roasted barley, scorched raw sugars with a mellow-minded earthy, woodsy quality from the spice and barrel. A pleasant, agreeable spiciness, particularly with the cinnamon without venturing into heavy-handed crap-can Red Hot candy territory. Dark fruitiness a little raisiny. Touches of vanilla creme, Dutch stroop. Subtle coffee infusion. Good amount of barrel character, it's certainly warming though never heated or hot.

Overall: Enjoyable.",4.2
Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,"2022 vintage. Poured from a waxed 22oz bomber into a snifter.  
 
Clear bistre kissed seal brown liquid topped by a lasting event-horizon of desert sand. Thick, fine lacing; shimmering sticky panes of tears; excellent retention. 
 
Champurrado, cocoa, cinnamon, and earthy coffee with a hints of kretek in the nose. Very mild. 
 
Intense palate entry, heavy/sharp sweetness with waves of blackstrap, coffee, walnuts, black currant, and fig. Moderate earthy bitterness washed away by the alcohol (hints of rum and irish whiskey, and port more than bourbon) and spice notes in the long medium finish. Low tartness with hints of oak comes and goes. 
 
Rich, creamy, medium-full bodied, with low astringency and good round carbonation. A tiny bit hot perhaps. 
 
An interesting base beer not overwhelmed by adjuncts, though quite coffee-forward at the moment.",4.39

Ephraim,"Canned on 5/25/22; consumed on 6/14/22 
 
Pours a hazy, largely translucent dark orange body topped with two fingers of fluffy, slightly off-white foam; good head retention leaves a half-finger of cap, a slim, frothy collar, and myriad spattering of webby/spotty lacing strewn across the walls of the glass. 
 
Aroma highlights dank orange oils and accents of sunflower petals/general florality upfront, leaving crackery malt lingering into soft, grassy resins glossing over soft lemon peel over time. 
 
Taste features waxy peach zest within a resinous overlay as grapefruit steadily washes over a catty/peppery undertone; light moss and wilted mint over the mid-palate fade to residual pine past the finish. 
 
Mouthfeel brings a medium body and a choppy fluff of moderate carbonation, dispersing dry textures and a pseudo-bittering over the mid-palate before eventually fading to a flaky crispness; a resinous glide brightens over the back end as bits of residual grit prickle the finish. 
 
A warming aggression peeks through the stability of crackery malt and floral resins, an unforeseen grit waving across the normally clean Hill IPA profile; the subtle bittering and choppier tones of earth the result ultimately lend to a slightly more varied and intense profile to contrast the largely delicate base.",4.25

The flavor is very juicy, and has the flavors I mentioned in the aroma. There's a bit of mango up front that fades to the grapefruit and pineapple on the back. These latter flavors really linger on my taste buds and in my throat. Heck, I will be burping pineapple and grapefruit for a while.

On the nose you get Phoenix Suns orange with some Miami Heat tropical pineapple notes. Was expecting a thick Shaq like body but it’s a more lean medium body, reminiscent of a Dwight Howard. Taste wise you get the traditional IPA bitter hop bite that gives a slight Celtics green herby taste. However it also has that new wave NEIPA melon, cream, citrus fruit flavor.

L: impenetrably-hazy, pale yellow-amber liquid with mildly golden highlights on the fringes... moderately tall foam rise on the pour, sinking back into a misty cap... bit of a letdown from the lame head retention and little lacing 
 
S: lime hull, lemon peel, mango funk, grapefruit pith; slight capsicum spicy accent... cream of wheat... vibrant greenness cutting through the perfumy fruits... the booze does boost the contact and seduction 
 
T: much more malt and mush than I'd anticipated, and it's great!; floral rush halfway, morphing into a tropical cleaver into the finish, during which a powdery grain flour note swells up and hangs up front long into the aftertaste... almost halfway through and wow! did the tropical hopping burst back onto my palate, fresh and enlivening... masterpiece of balance for its ilk 
 
F: only a faint sense of alcohol at the back of the palate; the milky grains and silky hop resins team to tame the heat I suppose... I wouldn't go any higher with the abv for this style; 7.5% is usually my sweet spot, and this is just tickling the tonsils, just inching toward unnecessary noxious-ity 
 
O: not a fan of hazies, but this shot right up into my top 3 or 4; they really do have a good thing going as I've very much enjoyed the unique character of each brand I've tried from them... I could definitely see getting this again (good excuse for another beer run to Maine); it has a lot going on for the style; some depth and dimension to the gritty grain bill; too smooth and moreish (2122)",4.62

Cable Car Kriek,"2021 vintage. Ruby red body with surprisingly little carbonation and no head whatsoever. Aromas are pretty standard kriek: cherry pie, lemon, hay, bit of vinegar. Very little funk, which is a bit unusual. Flavors are acetic but also semi-sweet, with predominant notes of cherry and apple cider vinegar. Feel is slippery and a bit flat due to the low carbonation. Overall I think this is one of those beers that made waves upon release when the idea of Belgian lambics was still relatively unknown in the US, but now that we have broader access to some of the best Belgium offerings here in the states it doesn't quite hold up. Especially given the price point ($90/750ml), I would not buy this again but happy to have the opportunity.

Cable Car Kriek,"2021 Vintage. 
 
Gorgeous ruby red pour; very few agitated bubbles of carbonation as it’s poured into the glass. It settles flat. 
 
The nose is still distinctly Cable Car, with noticeable yet restrained funk and lemony citrus. The cherry adds more brightness and is a fresh, fruity addition. With time, a lot of oak and Brett comes to the forefront. 
 
The palate is sour and noticeably acidic, with a surprisingly low carbonation. Was definitely hoping for more of it to cut that tart cherry and acid, but overall it’s never overwhelming. The tannin from the cherry works really well with the overall profile.  
 
As stated above, not sure if that much carb was lost since 2021 or it was just never very high, but I felt it needed more. That said, it drinks bright and refreshing, with restrained tannin.",4.28

Pours yellow out on the river. Summer winding down, let's finish it up. Hits some amazing funky sour spontaneous notes. And they said it couldn't be done on this side of the pond. Just a delight to smell. The best of what Tilamook has to offer. Boasts fresh french oak feels, bugs, grapefruit, lemon rind, bleu cheese, green apple yogurt. The gang's all here. 
 
The taste was such a nice thing, great bottle on one of those awesome yet sad close to summer beers. Made it memorable. Its vibrant, fresh cut hay and oak alongside some citrus wedges like you just stomped some kids at youth soccer. One of the best expressions of brett ever in a beer. Sawft body too, never felt too acidic or sour. This is honestly better than most Belgian gueuzes.

The Broken Truck,"Opened up No. 6 (1/20), 7 (1/21), and 8 (1/22) together and tasted side-by-side. 
 
All three boasted a beautiful golden yellow on the pour, with frothy, aromatic head that was slow to settle into the body of the beer. 
 
No.6 brought notes of lemon zest, oak, and white grape must on a sweet, musty backbone. No. 7 came on sweeter, with more of a citrus candy quality and a bit less Brett character. The oak component had more of a ""freshly cut"" aroma to it, and preceded notes of bleu cheese that I didn't get on No.6. No.8 was probably the most distinctly unique; white wine like with 7, but more of a grapefruit-specific citrus quality and a deeper complexity of wet hay and an overall better balance of sweet & funky. 
 
The palate on all three of these were led predominantly with drying tannin and bitter citrus peel. The oakiness was relatively similar amongst the three and bolstered the flavor influence from the yeast bill, however while No.8 showed its youth with the least amount of bitterness, 7 & 8 had comparable dryness and a more noticeable citrusy bitterness. No. 6 was also had the highest level of residual puckering tartness. 
 
Light-bodied, dry, and lightly bitter mouthfeel to all three. As mentioned, varying levels of tartness / acid, but all very soft in their carbonation and smooth in the finish. 
 
Overall, I'm honestly surprised with how similar each vintage of these beers was. Each had their own unique nuances, but when broken down you could find very similar characteristics on both the nose and the palate with both, characterizing a predominance of fresh oak, Brett, bitter citrus, drying tannin, and a noticeable albeit subtle funky/cheesy quality on the backbone. Definitely fun to have these all side-by-side.",4.29

16oz can served in a stemless wineglass. Dated 01/25/22. Received from @WunderLlama in NBS BIF #14. 
 
Pours super murky whitish yellow with a medium sized head that dissipates into a medium sized ring and a fairly large but thin island of fine bubbles in the center of the glass. Smell...well, for starters I been catching whiffs of it for where I set it, arm's length away (and I have long arms). Smell is gorgeously tropical juicy, pineapple/mango/orange. Lingering resin sense that is difficult to extricate from the tropical juicy stuff. 
 
Taste is much pithier / redolent of fruit skin than the aroma suggests. It's bitter up front, lots of resin, and the tropical juiciness is strong but lurking not-so-subtly in the background.

Focal Banger,"Enjoying on the front porch, gorgeous, cool August day, the 18th, 2023. (Canned on 8/15/23!) 
 
So excited to find this treasure at our Washington beer store. 
 
Gorgeous straw/light golden color, slightly hazy, with white foam of tiny bubbles, dissipated quickly leaving fine lace on glass edge. 
 
Very fruity aromas of pineapple, papaya, mango, luscious lemon and even malt! 
 
Immediate bitter hits the tongue which gives way to the fruit flavors and ends sharp grapefruit rind. 
 
This hits all the right notes for an excellent NEIPA for me! Leah prefers the sweeter Heady Topper, whereas I'll stick to this one as my favorite! 
 
Edit.... We had bought two cans, and we drank the second one fiber nights after the first one. I had worked hard on a pool electrical job in the sun that day, and WOW!... What an intense beer to drink after a hot day on the sun. By the time we were on the porch, it had cooled off considerably, and it was raining..... Drinking this Focal Banger was pure joy! Pine, hop, depth, in your face hoppy bitterness..... Pure joy!",4.55

F - medium, leaning on full bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth. 
O - another world class IPA from alchemist - a softer version of Heady",4.68

Beer poured a hazy golden with a nice white head that has sustained hang time. 
 
Nose is very nice, fresh citrus abounds from the glass long after pouring. 
 
Taste is spot on. The light pale malt base displays the grapefruit forward hops and it tastes like the pink grapefruit fresh off my tree at my old PHX house in the spring. Finishes with a superb rind and pine bitterness; 7/10 on my scale. 
 
Mouthfeel is light bodied with each sip very refreshing. 
 
Overall, yep, the hype is correct on this one. This is a world class ipa!",4.5
Focal Banger,"Canned on 7/18/23 - Just 15 days ago! 
 
Drank most from can as directed, but did pour 4 oz amount in rocks glass for appearance  
 
Appearance – The beer pours a lightly hazed lime-yellow color with a small head of white foam. The head has a good level of retention, fading slowly over time and leaving tons of streaky lace on the sides of the glass. 
 
Smell – The aroma is strong of a grapefruit and herbal hop smell mixed with notes of cracker malt and a touch of bread and toast. Other hop aromas of pine and earth, are there as well, with all the aromas having a fresh “raw” like smell. Hints of caramel and a sizeable grass like smell are there as well, giving a rather green smell overall. 
 
Taste – The taste begins with a crisp cracker malt body paired with a lot of the “raw” hop that was present in the nose. An herbal hop is the biggest, but is accompanied by a decent showing of grapefruit as well. Other light earthy flavors mix in as time goes on all while a little bit of caramel and orange that were present upfront fade. The grass that was in the nose also joins the scene, all with a bit of an increase in the hop. Toward the end, the fresh hop taste steps it up even more, giving a quite heave hop pellet like taste to linger on the tongue. 
 
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is medium in thickness and creaminess with a moderate carbonation. For the mix of big fresh hop with crisp body, the middle of the road mouthfeel balances the two attributes rather well. 
 
Overall – A rather fresh, raw hop pellet tasting IPA. I like it, but in some ways a bit unbalanced with bitterness at the end. Certainly, a great brew, although I am not sure it deserves as much hype as it gets.",4.34

Had with some chorizo sausages (a good meal); 11% so be careful :) Had this another night, and picked up a lot of cherry, maybe some chocolate. Buttery and smooth mouthfeel, pleasantly carbonated. That scotch taste is what does it for me in this beer, need to try more of this style.",4.45

Aroma is apricot right off the cuff, although it's mild and nuanced into the profile. Stone, lemongrass, and earth add some more depth. It has a pleasant tartness to it, leaning into a little acidity. Flavor profile takes the acidity up a notch, especially when served at fridge temperature. The acidity wanes as the beer warms. Apricot adds some sweetness, and is more forward than the nose, taking up a more dominate role. It's still well balanced and nuanced into the flavor profile. Cellar stone, earthy malts, grass, and lemon zest create the rest of the profile, all accompanied by some minor tartness. Mouth feel is still in effervescence, delivering a smooth texture. Thickness is medium. Overall, a tart apricot saison that delivers tasty simplicity.

Appearance: Deep gold color with 2-finger white head. It is deep with a very hazy complexion, like many New England IPAs. Head is very thick, and it lasts a minute, leaving a small covering. There is a medium amount of lacing on the glass. 
 
Smell: Strong aroma of citrus and pine, as well as some hops and pineapple. The citrus and pine aromas dominates the other aromas. 
 
Taste: Bitter taste from the hops with a moderate sweetness like citrus. The sweetness and bitter edge are well-balanced. Has a very nice after-taste that lasts a moderate amount of time. Overall a nice balance and very drinkable. 
 
Mouthfeel: Medium body. Average alcohol, which matches the 8.2% listed on the can.

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"From a 500ml bottle, dated 03/11/23. Served in a spiegelau tulip glass. 
 
Pours a thin-appearing oak-brown with no obvious highlights. A generous finger of lush, coffee colored foam doesn’t last but maybe 20 seconds leaving a narrow collar and a rousable spatter of oily, super-slippery lacing. 
 
Nose is… fruity? A sweet, candy-like coffee aroma and, totally unexpectedly, raspberry - which must be an olfactory hallucination, or at least how my brain is interpreting the combination of vanilla, cinnamon and chiles. 
 
Taste is sweet but not heavily so, with a berry-like coffee bean flavour and that fruity mélange of cinnamon-vanilla-chile pepper that my brain persists in translating as ‘raspberry’ bringing a brightness and lightness which keeps the beer from tasting syrupy. A slick Cadbury-like milk chocolatey character becomes more evident as the beer warms accompanied by some heat from the chiles. There’s a very faint soy sauce quality in the aftertaste which doesn’t detract much. 
 
Feel is oily-smooth and creamy-slick, medium bodied but a little light relative to the style with gentle, prickly carbonation. Chile heat builds up on the palate somewhat and amplifies the otherwise mild carbonation, lightening the mouthfeel further. 
 
Overall, pretty good but maybe a little bit of a mixed bag. I won’t call the flavours ‘muddled,’ but it is a very ‘busy’ flavour profile which, weirdly, for my palate, comes across very fruity and raspberry-like.",4.13
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"2022 pint can, chilled, left to warm. Flat black on the pour, thick, sticky, tiny bit of struggled foam that vanished fast. 
Smells like cinnamon, vanilla, cacao nibs, and chilli peppers being muddled together. 
Tastes the same. Just too much going on. Cloyingly sweet and thick, slightly gritty, too much cinnamon, and who needs hot peppers in their stout? 
Overall, I’ve attended 5 Hunahpu’s Day celebrations at the CCB Spruce Street brewery over the years and have bought a bottle or can each time and come away thinking the same thing: nice novelty.,. but way too busy and quite over rated.",3.88
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"2020 vintage received courtesy of @roguer.  
 
Appearance is typical for the style, which means it's a nice looking dark, dark brown with a half inch of tan colored head. Nice legs. Aroma is wonderfully rich and decadent, but not in an artificial way. Plenty of sweet molasses, chocolate, a hint of vanilla, and some faint figs / raisins. That description doesn't do this any real justice, so in summary, this beer smells great.  
 
Taste is interesting. Nowhere near as sweet on the nose, with some naturally bitter cacao notes, cinnamon and pepper combining brilliantly with the base beer. The spiciness is Goldilocks.....just right. A bit less and they wouldn't be notable. A bit more and they would overpower. There's a really nice sweetness deep into the finish that helps add to the complexity of this beer. Fully bodies and smooth, leaving a really nice coating on the tongue with a pleasant alcohol warming.

We’re nearing the end of the BIF beers I got from @Eziel back in February, and this one is a heavy hitter. This has been a big want for me for a while, so it’s awesome to finally be able to try it. Let’s see what this famoud spicy Stout is really all about 
 
Pours nearly pitch black with 2 fingers of reddish brown head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing 
 
This is highly complex in the nose, not too peppery and balanced in its sweetness. I’m picking up on aromas of cacao nibs, vanilla bean, chili pepper, spicy whiskey, burnt coffee, sweet toffee, brown sugar, and light charred oak 
 
This is a bit restrained in taste, perhaps due to the age but I still really enjoy it. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark chocolate, roasty coffee, chipotle pepper, vanilla bean, spicy whiskey, toasted oak, cinnamon, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of milk chocolate, chipotle pepper, vanilla bean, caramel, toasted oak, earthy whiskey, and burnt coffee 
 
A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth and earthy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a lingering heat 
 
While I enjoyed this, I’d hardly put it on legendary status. Again, maybe it’s the age so I’d love to try it fresh, but even still",4.31

Old Milwaukee Ice,"(16 oz can, OCT1419; purchased cold single... poured into fat tulip) 
 
L: brilliantly-clear, pale yellow-amber liquid; rather tall, 2-finger high, relatively dense, white foam... slow collapse of foam, rocky center, then incredibly thick, crusty collar left, actually some long bands of lace... looks superb! 
 
S: expected lightly-spiced, doughy aromas, with perhaps faint almond, vanilla notes... nutty, granola grain most dominant, but overall potency is a touch too mellow 
 
T: richly malty, but relatively dry on the back end, not to mention that overtone of lightly caramel-y nuttiness, almost like a biscotto... a couple sips in, and a semi-bold, mildly herbal, cooling bitterness takes hold in the aftertaste, faint sweetish booze hanging in the back; balanced well... vaguely industrial Belgian tripel esters/phenols - great in a malt liquor, but lame in an actual tripel 
 
F: as a malt liquor, this has a perfectly silky-smooth, lightly-luscious body, with a hearty quiet afterglow - for an AAL, it may have too rich of an initial contact, but falls short of any residual syrupy drag, though it ain't bone dry either... just divine, good grief; sipper or slurper, it does both 
 
O: either one of the best ice beers I've had (if not the best), or a perfect marriage was made between liquid (and temp) and glass... I got a sort of 2-for-1 deal on these cans - tempted to have the other right after this, but I may need a nap after (1516)",4.1

The mouthfeel is too thinly carbonated for the style.  
 
The finish is crisp, refreshing, light and watery, and fairly dry.",3.31

Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,"16 ounce can, thanks to my friend Laura for this one! Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a light reddish color with about an inch or so light pink head that didn't stick around for too long. Small amount of lacing. Aroma is nice but also subtle. The brew smells like tomato, salt, lime and a bit of clamato. Taste is similar to the aroma, but I do think the clamato and tomato have more of a kick here. There's also a bit of celery and grainy flavors noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's easy enough to drink. Overall I'd have to say this is average. It's not bad but not great either. I've had other Bloody Mary/Chelada style drinks before and there's others I like a lot more than this. But with that being said, this one isn't offensive at all and I'd drink it again. Probably wouldn't buy it for myself though.",3.19
Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,,3.44
Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,"Look, this is not your homemade Michelada. No one should get this expecting the flavors of a high quality bloody mary or something like that. Most of these reviews seem to be from lager drinkers who like flavored beer but don't understand what this is supposed to be. That being said, if you want an incredible hangover cure that has more of an msg taste than a salt taste (at least by comparison to a bloody or a homemade michelada) but is well balanced with the acid from the lime and tomato, this is your thing. The salt content is there enough that you will taste it, but very much more in a way that will make you grab this after a long bike ride rather than a day of sitting around. That being said, they're heavy enough in fill but light enough in alcohol that a couple of these will last you a day of sipping in the sun with no worries about driving home later. All in all, as a michelada lover and someone who has developed my own recipe based on tommy sandoval's, this is the one I keep coming back to when I need to remind myself what it's like, this is the base of the flavors that define this ""cocktail"" and it is wonderful for what it is. Chuck your own couple dashes of hot sauce or cut it with more beer, this mich is a utility, and I can respect that about it. Is it 5/5? no fuckin way, but I would challenge you to find a better canned michelada.",3.46
Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,,3
Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,A lot of people are not judging this michelada fairly. This is a great michelada that is a higher abv than most other micheladas on the market. The clamato adds a great flavor profile that is very refreshing and delicious. My only complaint is that it could use some more lime flavor I sometimes add a slice of lime to this and it makes it even better.,4.03

Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,"This one pours a weird and dead looking light red color, with a small head, and not much lacing. 
 
This smells like an old fetid tide pool, salt, warm rain water, pepper spice, and ketchup. 
 
I don’t know who this is made for, but it’s certainly not made for me. The back end is weirdly sweet tomato ketchup type flavors but also with an unpleasant spice to it. I don’t mind a bit of brine in certain beers, but it just feels so old and nasty with the clam juice in here. 
 
This is simultaneously super watery but also uncomfortably thick at times, with a weird slickness. It just kind of hurts going down.

Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,"(25 oz can, code 19236; purchased cold single... poured into a Gibraltar glass) 
 
L: cloudy, pinkish liquid; looks like a raspberry wit? but without any foam, suds of which explode and vanish on the pour... with subsequent pours, the murk gets murkier, and some nasty, spitty, tomato-y foam smears do cling, tomato specks abound 
 
S: moderately-intense emanation of tomato juice and limey brine on the nose, however, little if any 'clam'; smells innocent enough, not necessarily off-putting, unless you have a depressingly dull diet... certainly has a fresh, floral overtone 
 
T: tomato juice, mellow undercurrent of grain-soupy adjunct lager, light-moderate sea mist, barely a kiss of citrus color, but a rather forward peppery bite I wasn't expecting... almost a subtle tomato paste-y sweetness around the edges, but thankfully not sweetly-flavored like caramel or sugar... pepper and lightly malted tomato nectar prevalent in the aftertaste 
 
F: mildly spritzy carbonation coupled with the peppery bite makes for an enlivening, burn/sting upon the tongue/palate, mellow heat building an embery fire... take the flavors away, and it's arguably rather wit-smooth in its textures up front, and relatively prickly-hot at the back like perhaps an egregiously coriander-ed extra-triple 
 
O: should I be surprised that I enjoyed and was fascinated by this? - the recipe works well but, to my taste, I'd prefer a little more brine and maybe some umami-funk to give it more depth... not sure I'd quite go gangbusters experimenting on cocktail-ish flavor doctorings with this, but I can already think of a variety of ways to accent flavors here: lime wedge(s), (more) clam juice, anchovy oleo, celery salt, spicy mango, tequila chaser, et al... overtly Bloody Mary-like, noticeably/deliciously malty, and applicable within countless culinary scenarios - needs and begs to be paired with charred meats, oily carbs, spicy fruits etc etc... definitely going back for another - wow!

Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,"The best chelada bud makes. You get 25 ounces of tomato based clam beer beverage for $3, what more can you ask for? I'm an ipa guy, but the balance of spice, clamato, and budweiser creates a vortex of euphoria that smoothly slides down your throat. Look is typical of a chelada/michelada; off red/pink with floating bits of tomato. Smell is very tomato forward with the typical malt smell of budweiser. Taste is amazing, a perfect balance of spice and refreshing light beer, along with a decently high carbonation this is a great summertime beer..I drink a lot of these after being on the water all day, but also make great drinks after skiing too. A great all around beverage",4.74

F: Medium-light bodied, ample carbonation, smooth, yet finishes short and crisp. Easily sessionable. Quite refreshing! 
 
O: This is pretty fair offering for a Light Lager. Is it the absolute best of Light Lagers available? No, but it is fair.

This beer pours a clear, bright medium golden yellow colour, with four fingers of puffy, finely foamy, and only faintly fizzy off-white head, which leaves some random splotchy lace around the glass as it slowly and evenly abates. 
 
It smells of gritty and grainy cereal malt, dextrose, Corn Pops, white grape juice, and rubbing alcohol. The taste is bready and doughy, er, malt, simple syrup, white wine dregs, the water in which you boiled the corn, sugary booze, and some ethereal earthy and dead floral bitterness. 
 
The carbonation is pretty unremarkable in its milquetoast frothiness, the body a solid middleweight, and actually fairly smooth, with only the firewater essence maybe acting as the fly in the proverbial ointment, to wit. It finishes off-dry, the generic malt and muted frooty notes fixing for a lingering donnybrook. 
 
Overall - yeppers, this is exactly what the doctor (a known quack, but still) ordered, and actually quite tolerable when fridge-cold. However, the honeymoon fades fast as things start to warm, so I'd say that puts this one smack dab dead center in the bullseye of this style, amirite?",2.78

Aroma is a bit rough on this one. And. Lots of assetelda hide green Apple smell that's just a bit off mixed with a Is corny light malt. A bit chemically like Fusel alcohol like a lot of ice beers are. 
 
The acetyl to hide comes through on the taste as well again with the light Corning malt and a bit of sweetness although it isn't overwhelming. For the most partless beer is pretty drinkable. 
 
Feels just a bit too big to be a refreshing AAL, and a bit too syrupy to be a nice bigger lager. Still for the ABV it's easy to put down.

Nose is bright and citrusy and otherwise has a faint cereal character. Aroma of lime, just as advertised. 
 
Taste is corny and soapy with tart-tacky citrus. Tasting the titular lime, Corn Pops breakfast cereal and seltzer water.  
 
Feel is slick and soapy, medium-thin bodied with fizzy, seltzer-like carbonation. In fact, each sip finishes not entirely unlike lime-flavoured seltzer water.

Bud Light Lime,"24oz can, poured in a glass. 
 
On the pour thre fingers of head form, with some retention off the bat, but after a moment, instead of a rocky head forming, it got fizzy and dissipated. Body is a completely clear gold. For a light lime lager, this is looking real fake. 
 
Aroma is mostly the same lime flavor that comes on hint of lime chips, which I don't hate, probably because of the ""real lime peels"" used. In the back there is a carbonic acid aroma like generic seltzer water, with a very light bud light funk. Smells blandly acidic with a ""hint of lime"". 
 
Taste follows the aroma, but admittedly loses the off flavors. Still however those is very bland and would probably be most enjoyable after a strong malt liquor while outside in very hot weather. This is about as flavorful as a lime truly, but with a slight and light reminder that this is beer with a very vague malt character at the end. 
 
Feel is the only decent category here. It is drinkable like regular bud light, but it almost comes off as even more watery. Despite that the lime flavoring amd possible sweetener makes the finish long amd a bit syrupy. Meh. 
 
Overall the only reason to drink this is if you can't afford leinie's summer shandy, but you desperately need something different than the cheap lagers in the 24oz cooler at the gas station.",2.33

On the pour, a finger of sudsy, verging on fizzy head formed with surprisingly decent retention. Head settles at a fine but thin covering. Body is highly carbonated and a clear, golden, yellow. 
 
Aroma is very close to bisch light, but perhaps slightly more substantial. There's definitely corn in this beer. Cheap macro smell, but not the worst. 
 
Taste follows the aroma. Slightly fuller busch light. Decent doughy grainy thing and it doesn't taste too watered down. 
 
Feel is surprisingly full, drinkable and refreshing, but not heavy. This is actually a smooth macro lager.

Aroma is immediately skunky but present classic American and or noble hops. A bit of a Metallic aroma backs the skunk somewhat pleasantly? Surprisingly light aroma. 
 
Flavor is sweet and bready woth a touch of that skunky hop still present. Arguably almost syrupy sweet, but not a bad beer. Actually quite smooth and soft with an almost nutty malt character.

So, I took my $1.99 and bought a 24 ounce can. Wow. In some ways it was more sad than bad. 
I understand that in the past 5.9 ABV was a big deal, and dudes just purchased it to get their drunk on, but nowadays that's considered lightweight. Okay, those beers likely cost more than $1.99.

Olde English 800,"Dark gold, amber looking color. Had 1 finger of white head on the pour and quickly lost half that. Looks like the half left is slowly dropping as I type. Lazy streaming carbonation visible. 
 
Nose is a touch sweet. Grain smell on the nose comes through. Like corn grain. 
 
The mouth is sweet and a bit of a malt like flavor. Seems simple on the taste, lets put the two together, now we have sweet malts. Is it overly sweet? No.  
 
Mouth feel starts as a bit medium and finishes surprisingly well. A touch of lingering sweet malt and yes there is the grain on the back of the mouth that sits there for a minute. 
 
I am in las Vegas, NV and was able to get the 7.5% ABV version and I did chill the crap out of the 24 oz. can before I cracked it. I think if this higher ABV (higher than the 5.9% ABV version) were to get warmed up it may have that malt liquor taste I find unpleasant. Kind of that, ""I am trying to be a lager, why the shit did they add this fructose syrup to spoil me?"", type of thing. If this were to warm up and had a sweeter taste were to come out I would say no way. I will say I have had much worse malt liquor beers for sure. Still searching for my final opinion. The one thing I do not like is I find myself trying to drink it before it warms. And today is a warm day, even though I am inside.. O.K. Maybe that is what this is for, fast slam hopefully quick buzz on a cheap beer, kind of a Four Loko ""beer"" thing. Enough rambling. How about will I buy it again? The higher ABV warming does come through a bit towards the end as I try to chase a chilled product. Buy it again is still a questionable thought. I really do not think I would try this again unless I could get the lower ABV. More along the lines of an Icehouse beer. Yet there may be a fit for this with some heavy meats on a good BBQ day. Damn now I am just hungry? This has been an exhausting push and pull beer review. I really look forward to more people trying the higher gravity and seeing what they think. I think at 5.9% and being cheap, again around the Icehouse region, this might work. I know people look for the ""higher gravity"" one, yet now I seek the ""lower gravity"" one"". So sorry for the ramble ladies and gents, Cheers!",2.85

O: this is the driest and lightest tasting on the malt liquors I've tried. You can tell it shares the AB bloodline, in a blind test Hurricane could easily be mistaken for one of the Budweiser or Busch beers. If you like Bud, you'll probably like Hurricane.",3.12
Hurricane Malt Liquor,"The head fizzled away fairly quickly, but there are still a large amount of bubbles forming an rising to the top to quickly have their gas escape into the world. 
 
The nose is a mix of malt and weak brown sugar sweetness and metallic medicinal notes that are filling in for hop bitterness in an unsuccessful attempt. It's actually somewhat off-putting. 
 
Luckily, the taste avoids the aroma's pitfall. It's actually not that bad. It has a little bit of toast mixed in with the sweetness that it brings. And it's not overly sweet by any means. There's a generic bitterness that I might argue is slightly woody (maybe it had some contact with some beechwood chips). There's a slight unripe banana note in the aftertaste.

O: skunk not as bad as others... goes down pretty easy, and it grew on me, but I'd recommend drinking it colder to avoid the odd hard candy element - it's not that bizarre of a flavor for something like this, seemed to trail off, but lacks a secondary flavor to 'balance' it... at any rate, surprised at its relative quality - didn't intend to, but drank almost the whole bottle",3.51

Doesn't suggest a syrupy or watery beer, but I'm reading it as on the thicker side based on this aroma. Hop profile isn't completely absent; I think I get some mild grassiness. Suggests an innocuous malt liquor with no egregious flaws but plenty of shortcomings in terms of complexity, depth of flavour, subtlety, balance, and build. Aromatic intensity is below average. Doesn't seem boozy and I detect no off-notes. 
 
Taste is indeed innocuous and inoffensive, which is high praise for a malt liquor. Sure, there's a bit too much 6 row and pale malt sweetness as well as corn adjunct, and it's a bit too thick, but it isn't syrupy or watery and it isn't cloyingly sweet or overly adjunct-emphatic. I've certainly had worse, and there's a slight scintilla of grassy hop flavour to its credit.  
 
Certainly not dialed-in, but it's not imbalanced. Shallow and simple, but approachable and pleasant enough for a 6% ABV malt liquor offered in the 40 oz format. Let's be fair - there's far worse out there. This may be a bit insipid, but that isn't always a bad thing in the budget beer category. 
 
Texture is slightly overcarbonated and crisp. Unrefreshing owing to its slightly syrupy feel and overly thick presence on the palate. Has too much weight on the palate for a beer as insipid as this. Not oily, gushed, tannic, astringent, rough, hot, boozy, or scratchy. This mouthfeel doesn't elevate the beer as a whole or accentuate specific flavours, but it also doesn't clash with the taste. 
 
Overall, it's mediocre at best, but it's one of the better (least bad?) attempts at the style I've tried recently. $2.99 USD plus tax and deposit is as fair a price as you'll find in Manhattan for such an inoffensive brew, and this is probably up there with Ballantine XXX in terms of my go-to budget 40oz format brews. Many will shit on this because it happens to be brewed by Anheuser-Busch, but in a blind taste test I'm confident it'd outperform most competing brands. Judging it strictly to style, it's actually pretty decent fare and I won't mind taking down the entire 40oz bottle.

Hurricane Malt Liquor,,1
Busch Beer,"So I’m doing some twerking outside the window of a Denny’s when I’m violently tackled—it’s the police—face first into an unopened can of Busch. I slide it into one of the spacious pockets of my JNCOs (50” pipes) just before I’m hoisted upright. Just when things are looking grim, my best mate Gordon Blevins slithers out of the pawn shop next door with a fist full of bills and the unmistakable swagger of a man who can now afford Cinnabon for dinner. 
 
Gordon is brilliant. He convinces the officers that I am just that over-the-moon for a Moons Over My Hammy, which is true. He also informs them that I haven’t been quite right since I found out my step-cousin Cynfia is having triplets and I might not not be the dad. Once I’m out of the cuffs and comfortably seated with my Hammy, I remember the Busch swimming somewhere in the sea of denim below. A little spelunking does the trick, and I’m b’s deep in Busch. 
 
Looks… yeah, it got em. Have you seen this design? It’s a focking snow-capped mountain range. Clamp a clothespin around your nostrils because what it boasts in taste, it lacks in scent. Like, it smells of Aunt Deberly’s full-coverage underwear I dug out from ‘twixt the futon cushions with my teeth. Feels like wet beer. Overall, I chose a number from the dropdown menu not even remotely commensurate with this beer's quality.",3.54

King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor,"Poured into a 12oz glass from an undated 25oz can. 
 
On the pour a decent 1.5 finger white head formed. The head has decent retention but it's a pretty fast dissipation to a thinner cap. The body is a solid gold with lots of fine carbonation. 
 
Aroma us a bit rough. Some off apple juice and a bit of a funky lager. A bit malty other than that but meh. 
 
Taste has a bit of off flavor. There is a nice malty sweetness right off the bat and it's quite attenuated and stays pretty balance. There is a twinge of tartness, but for the style this is decent. Biscuity finish with a hint of corn. 
 
Feel is drinkable and relatively crisp, but it's not the most chuggable beer with some odd esters here and there. Medium finish with a pretty neutral mouthfeel.

L: inch-high foam on pour, sitting atop a polished-clear, brass-colored liquid; the foam is actually relatively dense and glossy, receding surprisingly slow... holds a half-moon crescent collar and, dang, if there isn't 3-4 thick bands of lace - huh? 
 
S: very pale, almost flour-like, vaguely corn-flaky grain smell dominates, mellow toasted note; mildly grassy-herbal overtone

F: certainly a vibrant effervescence, bubbling and rumbling the center of each sip, with a few healthy belches as proof... the body itself is on the meatier side of light 
 
O: first time having this in perhaps 25 years, last time being likely a lukewarm can awash in a sea of melting ice in a cooler at a gathering in the woods (or one of my other many haunts)... had no recollection of this being a Miller product, but given my inclination toward their brands, I could honestly see getting this again, even, just maybe, a 30 pack (I've seen em) (1722)",3.9
Red Dog,Pours a translucent gold like any other aal with a white head that dissipates immediately. Smells like wet grain with a touch of just enough hops to let you know it's not a light beer.

Carlton Cold,"I recently reviewed Victoria Bitter which I drank for old time's sake by chance and it reminded me of one of the other beers I drank whilst in Australia; Carlton Cold. 
 
I wanted to review this beer because unlike VB which I liked at the time but recently gave a very poor review, this beer I disliked even at the time so I wanted to see if it really is as bad as I remember.  
 
My friend recently went to Australia so I asked him ton grab me a bottle so I could review it. 
 
Poured most of a 355ml bottle into a 350ml beer glass. 
 
Poured a pale watery yellow with a very loose, low head that disappeared almost immediately. No lacing. 
 
Nose was extremely disappointing. A faint hoppy aroma, some other faint but unidentifiable aromas. maybe chemical. Horrible. 
 
Palate. Much the same as the nose; faintly hoppy and watery. No complexity or malt. Horrible. Probably worse than the nose. 
 
Mouth was watery with very loose medium to heavy artificial carbonation. Horrible. 
 
Overall, probably even worse than I remember. An almost unbelievably woeful attempt at brewing beer. Breweries that churn out abominations like this shouldn't be allowed to call it lager or beer. It should perhaps be called ""Carlton Cold - Adjunct Grain Derivative"" 
 
Absolutely horrible. Highly unrecommended.",1.02

Carlton Cold,"Format: a standard clear 355mL bottle with that old Carlton Cold macro label. I get the feeling that CUB has dropped Cold from being a full strength to a mid at 3.5% (as this bottle is) when they started their big advertising campaign a year or so ago. I used to drink Cold at barbeques because I was a poor student. Let's revisit it at 3.5% and see if it is any good. 
 
Appearance: poured out a light yellow in colour with a continual swirling cascade of carbonation. Even with a fairly generous pour, very little head pops up - just a light white cap and ring. 
 
Aroma: this has a smell? I got so close to try and smell it that I accidentally snorted some, which was both embarrassing and a bit of a mistake. Once it was clinging to my nose (and possibly my brain), I got wet cardboard and some cheap grains. Great. 
 
Taste: a pretty damn awful cheap grain and corn adjunct dominates what little flavour this thing has. One of the rare few beers that actually makes me pull a weird face. 
 
Aftertaste: drops away quickly with just a touch of sweetness coming through from the grain. 
 
Mouth feel: light and watery in body with a mouth-filling carbonation. Not great. 
 
Overall: for the sake of my many barbeque memories, I will assume that the Carton Cold that I used to drink 10 years ago (the full strength 4.9%) was less bad than this 3.5% that you get now. This beer manages somehow to be both boring, and taste bad. Most of it was donated to the Gods of the sink. It's only AU$40 a case, but seriously, just drink water or something. It certainly tastes better.",1.62
Carlton Cold,"Just a typical Aussie macro lager. Whilst the taste is not offensive and thankfully lacks the coin flavour that many others feature, it is just so plain and unimaginative that I couldn't commend it in any way other that to say it does not make me recoil.

Taste: Starts out with cereal grains and straw but with a watered down taste to it before wafts of spotty floral hop notes peek in occasionally. Corn comes on in the second act and lingers before grains and water close it out 
Mouthfeel: Light and watery, clean, medium-high carbonation, and a clean and crisp finish 
Overall: What can I say – it’s Coors Light. The watered down sibling of the Banquet beer is exactly that and doesn’t bring much to the table aroma nor taste-wise, although refreshing on a hot day when your thirsty. I would and do pick a ton of non-light AAL’s over this when the occasion calls",2.36

Golden, bubbly, crisp, a little corny, and hydrating. This may hurt some feelings, but it tastes similar to Hamms or PBR, but less than them in some weird way. Who cares about doing a legit beer review with taste, mouthfeel, etc. It’s an adjunct lager, and a tasty, crushable one at that.

At that time, my ""beer palate"" wasn't all that developed, and the extra malt flavor of this beer was appreciated, since I was drinking pilsners at the time. 
30 years later, I stumbled across the 25 oz cans in a local gas station (I never said it was highbrow) and decided to give one a shot. Upon arriving home, I cracked the can open and poured (most of) the beer into a 16 oz glass.  
The color is light (for a malt) and the head is respectable due to the fairly high carbonation. The first sip brought back memories of the caramel-malt flavor I remembered from years ago. It was refreshing and was a good match for the 102-degree heat.

Nobody even gave it a chance as a $21 6-pack. I digress though. 
 
The beer honestly looks pretty nice - it as a slightly darker shade of yellow than most adjunct lagers and has a copper-y colour to it that makes it resemble almost exactly the bottle of maple whiskey that is sitting on my table. Not bad on that front. 
 
The smell is also not bad. It's got the standard adjunct smell, but it has some kind of deep, fruity smell that makes smelling it almost interesting and is not offensive, especially considering the beer vatriety. Smells good; looks good; what could go wrong? 
 
Well, after the first sip, I very well knew what went wrong. The taste of this beer is just bad, bad, bad. It's a corny burst on the tongue with an explosion (no joke, it felt that way) of sour aftertaste.

That said I do like me some light beers and I'm surprised it took me more than 500 different beers tried before I got to this one. This is beer 514 (actually more but some I couldn't find on here) and with that accumulated experience I will say this is a fine, if not, damn decent light beer. Blew my expectations away and I think I prefer it to the Extra or Premier.

Corona Light,"I've been waiting my whole life for this. It's the first time I've ever gotten a Corona Light when I asked for it. I've never even seen it at grocery stores. Although, to be fair, I've only looked once or twice--but god damn, this was at huge box stores with massive macro selections. To be perfectly honest, I was damn near certain this was a hoax that didn't actually exist. So it was to my utter surprise that our local dirt cheap Mexican restaurant not only listed it on their menu, but actually delivered it to the table as ordered. Thus was my ultimate bucket list whale slayed. 
 
The overall experience is, as expected, light, ricey skunk. However, it was also surprisingly toasty. I typically find the lighter versions of macro lagers to be the lesser of its representations, but since I have only ever had ""regular"" Corona Extra up until now, I'm finding myself flummoxed that I'm not entirely sure that Light is the worse of the two. Bottle to bottle, I'd probably take this over Extra. Even the lightly fluffy medium body isn't impacted too terribly by the ""lightening."" 
 
To wrap this up, the appearance within a lime wedged bottle--which itself I find slightly less attractive than Extra--is otherwise lightly chill-hazed piss yellow with, after a tilt, a relatively active but rapidly receding carbonation. 
 
Don't worry, I removed the lime wedge and serviced the tip liberally prior to this exhaustive review.

Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,Great example of a michelada,3.83
Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,"Poured from a can into a pint glass 
Appearance – The beer pours a murky tomato juice color with almost no head of foam. 
Smell – As would be expected the nose is heavy of a tomato juice and clamato smell. Mixed with these aromas is a light graininess and a touch of mustiness. 
Taste – The taste starts out with a quite sweet and salty clamato taste with a little bit of light breadiness. This pretty much sums up the majority of the taste throughout. Not good! 
Mouthfeel – With the clamato, the brew is slightly thicker and chewier with a lower carbonation.  
Overall – Nope. Not going back to this one. I sometimes like clamato in a light lager, but this is over the top in clamato. Way too much and way to sweet and salty. It’s a no go.",1.8

Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy reddish/pinkish color with about an inch pink cola-like head that fizzled away pretty quick. Not much if any lacing at all. The brew smells like tomato juice, clamato, salt and a bit of lime. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's some mineral and peppery flavors noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating, smooth and enjoyable to drink. Truthfully, the longer I drink it the more I like it. I don't know if it's because of the clamato, but this is a big improvement over the Modelo Chelada I had earlier today. I'd definitely buy this one again.",3.6

On the pour 1 finger of perfectly average head formed then recedes pretty quickly to a decent cap. The body is your typical AAL color with fine medium carbonation.  
 
Aroma is like sex in a canoe.... after eating a single peanut, I can't pick up much of anything at all. At least it's clean I guess. Some slight corn way off in the distance. 
 
Taste is stronger than the aroma but not by much. Super light but at the same time it is super clean as well. Some corny ""malt"" off in the background again but slightly stronger. Tastes like corn flakes steeped in carbonated water. 
 
Feel is bigger than the taste and aroma suggest with the actual feel of beer as opposed to Budweiser Zero which feels like beer flavored soda. Medium short finish with a mouthcoating feel. Carbonation mixed with the decent head is a big driving force here. 
 
Overall I wish Anhueser Busch would get it together and make a beer with the feel of this and the taste of budweiser zero, or at least make this have more flavor. If the taste was stronger it would remind me a lot of Tivoli Outlaw Lager.",3.06

Smells very neutral.  
Tastes like bread, crackers, malted grain, very little in the way of hops. Crisp with a surprisingly nice aftertaste. There’s a little alcohol heat on the backend as well, probably from being brewed with rice or corn syrup.  
I think this beer gets a bad rap because it’s cheap, it also makes good micheladas if your into that.",4

Which i think makes it good for what it is, im just not lookin for it. on the ice beer scale, lower in terms of choice, if one had the options of course. not everyone is as fair as i.",2.18
Bud Ice,"Poured from an undated 12oz can. 
 
On the pour a fizzy soda like head forms then quickly disappears entirely. Carbonation is very lively and the color is a yellow gold. 
 
Aroma is rough. A bit of green apple off sweetness followed by a skunky note and finished by a rough bad smell that I couldn't say where it came from. Smells like expired cider even ice cold. 
 
Flavor isuch better than the aroma fortunately with some malts actually present. Zero hops however. A fuel and alcohol flavor is present in the very back despite only being 5.5% abv. Has the same ricey light note as standard bud. Not the worst, bit not good. To be honest everything leading up to this had me expecting worse. 
 
Feel is light watery and has a lot of co2 bite. Despite all its flaws, when ice cold this beer is relatively refreshing, and some head does form when sipped despite being headless in the glass. It gets the job done but it's still not great. 
 
Overall this is just a cheaper stronger version of budweiser. If you like bud and are on a budget this might be fore you, but MHL is the same price and scores better in every category.",2.25

APPEARANCE: pours a clear, light golden color with one-finger white head that quickly dissipated until only a ring of small bubbles remained around the rim, appears to be lightly carbonated, minimal lacing on the glass. 
 
SMELL: light cornbread, that's about all I got from it, pretty one dimensional. 
 
TASTE: the taste sadly followed the nose, kind of watery and bland, light taste of sweet cornbread and the hops are nearly imperceptible, it's not complex, this is a one trick pony and it's not a very imaginative trick. 
 
PALATE: this is the worst score I have ever given in this category, it was watery and lacked an appropriate level of carbonation, most unpleasant. 
 
OVERALL: this is a terrible beer, if I was invited fishing with a buddy and this is all he had for us to drink, I would politely and reluctantly drink it, but next time I'll bring the beer.

Busch Light,"25oz can best by July 2nd 2023 
 
On the pour it was fizzy one second then completely headless the next. Honestly looks like a cider or sparkling apple juice. 
 
Aroma is better than expected and largely clean other than a huge green apple acetaldehyde presence. Super light in aroma, with a light watered down grain finish, but not pissy smelling like natty or keystone. 
 
Taste is again higher quality than it's cousins and competitors, but still incredibly watery and lacking in flavor. Tastes like a decent lager that was watered down severely. Finish is sweet barley and corn. 
 
Feel is the closest to beer flavored seltzer I think I've gotten other than Michelob Ultra, but this is super chuggable fizzy, and almost not there other than immense carbonation. Despite that the finish is quite long. Feels better when ice cold but has a crisp finish. 
 
Overall this is the definition of halfway decent, and not quite in a good way. Although better than most of the macro light lagers, especially for the price point, the things I like about it just don't hit with enough force, almost forcing you to chug the beer for any sort of satisfaction.",2.65

L - Thick, near-syrupy bright scarlet with a sort of opaqueness to it. 1mm pale rust head that disappears nearly instantly. 
S - V8, clams, and gasoline. Mineral, almost like salt. Slight rice backing. 
T - Heavy ethanol and lime notes lead way to even heavier clam and V8 flavors. Though barely noticeable, rice and wheat are present. Black pepper finish. 
F - Viscous and barely carbonated. 
O - Before I could make out any flavor, the first thing that came to my head was ""what the fuck did I just drink?"" For the sake of being 100% fair with everything I drink (and in recognition that this is likely an acquired taste), I drank the whole thing - about two and a half glass pours. First off, it's bad. Getting that out of the way, it's not as bad as you'd first think! It tastes like clamato and lime. Like a really terrible bloody mary. I should note that bloody mary cocktails aren't really my thing, but I get the appeal. This beer would definitely be better if it had some heat to it, and a lot more black pepper. Maybe some celery.

Pours a clear yellow gold with a 2 finger white head with 1 ring of lacing. 
 
Initial aroma is general lager smell, mostly yeast, with a good amount of pineapple, as well as some lemon and starting to ferment green apple. Pretty nice honestly. After smelling a few more times I pick specifically that the yeast is a crusty white bread smell, any yeasty type that's dusted with flour that you can tear apart. After agitating I notice almost a yogurt bacteria strain aroma. 
 
Initial taste before swallowing is light yeast and maybe biscuity malt. This becomes slightly peppery/tingly and floral. After swallowing it becomes lightly sweet, lightly nutty, and the peppery floral taste grows stronger and remains in the aftertaste. 5.9 ABV but I can actually taste some alcohol. 
 
Feel is thin but not watery and not super crisp or refreshing. Additionally the carbonation fades quickly. Honestly though fairly smooth and I don't dislike it.

Taste follows the aroma with the bright green apple bitterness, but I do pick up a touch if grain and adjunct in the back but not much else. Before becoming accustomed to the flavor it did come off as a bit boozy. 
 
Feel isn't quite chuggable, but I think there may be some fusel alcohols that are just making things sort of harsh. Not as drinkable as some malt liquors despite the relatively quick finish.

This beer has also been found to be the most cost efficient way to get sloshed outside of drinking hard alcohol. (At least in my area) Its a college essential that I would put above textbooks.",2.72

Busch Ice,"When enjoying a beer it’s important to take price into account. This is not an outstanding beer—far from it. But it provides a decent amount of alcohol for a mainstream lager. It smells like alcohol and green apples. The taste is crisp, but bland. Mostly cereal grains with a faint hint of hops. Aftertaste brings back that ethanol theme.

Busch Ice,"Poured into a tulip (which was a mistake, keep reading...) from deep chill fridge. Can form factor.  
 
A: Very clear pale straw yellow. 2 mm stark white head shrinks to a thin ring and slight lacing. 
 
S: typical cheap vomitous AAL hops with a swish of banana ester in the background. Not the strong point and the tulip concentrated it. Eww.  
 
T: actually not as gross as nose. Keep it cold. Use a koozie. If you do not do this it gets a little chalky as it warms. Corn flakes. Grainy. Slight hint of less than Carapils malt notes. Hops are slight and maybe on the mildly earthy and a were tiny hint of herbal note that peeks at warmer temps. Nothing too egregious but nothing too exciting.  
 
M: creamy medium body that leaves some slick mouthfeel behind. Nothing harsh at edge of tongue. Very slight chalkiness at warmer temps.  
 
O: I got this for an aggregate price of 55 cents a can, and 5.9% ABV. If I cut this with 50% water I get a beer equivalent to Miller64 for about 27 cents per 12 oz beer equivalent. I can't touch Miller64 for that price and any other beer in this range is far worse vomitious walrus piss. It has merit in this sense, but not much else.",3.16

Busch Ice,"It’s definitely not awful. It’s not great or mind blowing but it’s a decent tasting lager that’s also really cheap.  
It’s very light straw, clear, decent white head with surprisingly good retention.  
Smell is sweet malt and mineral water, a hint of sulfur.  
Tastes semisweet with a tart finish, not exactly sour but tart. There’s a slightly sour aftertaste that I actually enjoyed. This sample is from a 16 oz can.  
I can’t say this would be my go-to beer but at $5.79 for a sixer of pints it’s for sure a good value for those on a budget. (I’ve been there before).  
The finish is crisp and semi dry.  
It also makes good michelada’s if you’re into those. There’s absolutely nothing better after you’ve been out working in some really hot weather. (Start with 1 part Clamato and 2 parts beer. Add Tabasco, lime, tajin, even some orange juice. It doesn’t have to be precise. Enjoy",3

Busch Ice,"Anheuser-Busch ""Busch Ice"" 
25 fl. oz. can coded ""22102 WA1009"". Sampled on 7 May 2022 
$1.79 @ Carool's Discount Liquor, Merchantville, NJ 
 
Notes via stream of consciousness: It's a good thing I bought ""THE BIG ONE"" seeing as how this is rated ""Awful"" on beeradvocate. Ehh, it was only $1.79 and I got to get 'the eye' for going into a store in Camden, NJ that I damned well knew I shouldn't be in. (I know, I know, it's technically Merchantville - I can't figure out how that's possible - but it's a block away from what's technically Camden). What can I say, I like the weirdo beers and malt liquors! It's poured a clear straw gold body beneath a finger's width of white foam. The head seems to be holding pretty well so it seems pretty good so far. The aroma is limited to a generic but clearly adjunct-enhanced beer. There are no real hops, just a smear in the background. On the upside it's clean, but this isn't a malt liquor, it's just 5.9% ABV so I wouldn't expect anything weird. On to the taste... it follows the aroma which is a good thing in that it's clean, but bad in that it's fairly boring; t here is a little bit of an apple-like fruitiness to it though. It's lightly sweetish and thus nicely balanced by a moderate bitterness and generic background hoppiness. The alcohol never shows but then again at 5.9% it shouldn't, although it is possible, I assure you. It finishes mainly dry with a very short lingering finish. It's basically the same beer from start to finish except that you get a little more malt upfront and the apple doesn't step in until mid-palate. I've had worse European light lagers that have had more character to them but weren't nearly as well made, and then there's the beers from the Baltic region and Russia that honestly seem like they've been brewed with anti-freeze. Of course in parts of Russia that could be a selling point - 'Whatever Beer - Keeps You From Freezing!"". So we're basically done here. In the mouth it's medium on the lighter side, and gently crisp-then-smooth.",3.34

Keystone Light,,1.57
Keystone Light,"Poured into a pilsner glass straight from the fridge. 
 
Pours a slightly pale (meaning less vibrant, not less bright) yellow gold with a 1 finger fairly quickly dissipating white head. 
 
Initial aroma is very yeasty with a little peppery hop smell, kind of a light olive green smell. It's a little musty. 
 
After agitating I pick up more more hoppy smell, as well as a hint of ammonia maybe? 
 
Initial taste is seriously like drinking a flavoured seltzer. After a noticeable delay this is followed by a very strong (as strong as a light beer can be) taste of crusty white bread. This carries over to the aftertaste, where a rather mild bitterness also expresses itself in the back of the roof of the mouth, and the back of the sides and top of the tongue. 
 
There really isn't anything more I can pick up on unfortunately, but I mean I'm sure it's brewed with simplicity in mind. 
 
Mouthfeel is unsurprisingly very thin, and as previously stated, it's extremely similar to the experience of drinking seltzer. I understand I can't hold it accountable because of the style but it just doesn't take hold anywhere in the mouth 
 
Might buy again if it's very very cheap, but I can't see myself ever drinking this outside the setting of a party or to get hammered, and I don't have the desire to push my intoxication too far. So not likely. It's honestly not bad! It's just, y'know. 
 
I will say that as someone who counts calories it's honestly decent and I appreciate having it as an option, there are better options but not bad.",2.5
Keystone Light,"Keystone light is simply the poor man’s coors light. It doesn’t taste exactly the same, but its similarities puts it in the no frills class competitor. Ironically coors makes it, and I assume it sells as much keystone light as it does coors to select crowds.  
 
The beer itself is tailored towards budget conscious crowds. The can designs is identical to coors lights can and the pour & mouthful feel is similar.

A: Light, fizzy, straw yellow color. Head isn't great, but there is more than on the last cheap beer I just tried .. Appears well carbonated. 
S: Light grains. Muted fruitiness. Doesn't smell like much, but I suppose that is to style.. 
T: Tastes like run of the mill American Adjunct Lager. Corn, grain. No flavors of wet cardboard or paper, which is always a plus. Touch of 'sweetness'?  
M: Smooth, crisp, clean, watery, very drinkable. 
Overall, I suppose I would call it ""to style"".. Miller Lite is the staple beer in my household, and I would call this one a pretty close contender for the quintessential AAL / Light Lager / Palate Cleanser / Beer to have when you just wanna have a beer..

Natural Light,"A perennial classic, natural light evokes feelings of belonging and good times. It is the habit of the fool to judge a book by its prose, grammatical correctness, or coherent story. The learned man forms his judgement of its value based on how it makes them feel deep inside. A book that makes me feel good, I could read 15-20 times in one day. I can delete 15-20 nattys (colloquial term) in a day; it makes me feel good.",2.92

Natural Light,"From a 12oz can: 
 
Appearance: Clear pale yellow, ok head at first, fades out quickly. 
 
Smell: Vague hay/grass first, then vague sweet fruitiness? 
 
Taste: Remains vague, following the smell, kind of light cracker taste I suppose. Very light bodied, it's light beer! 
 
Overall: Had to pick up a 12 of the retro label to review. Natty light is infamous where I went to college (Iowa State) due to the basketball coach (Larry Eustachy) being pictured among co-eds from the U of Missouri drinking said beverage. Natty is slightly better than Bud Light, but has very little flavor, so I'll continue to pick up Miller Lite or Coors Light when I want a light beer.",2.1

S: 4 - grapefruit, citrus, and pine. Sweetness from the crystal malts is present with a caramel aroma. Slight toffee to the smell, too. 
 
T: 4.5 - Begins with an interplay of a candy like sweetness with herbal-orange flavor that rounds itself out with bitterness from the hop resins. mineral quality on the back end that is refreshing and announces the bitterness.

F: 4 - medium to full bodied. Carbonation was soft and pleasant. 
 
O: 4.5 - in my mind, this is THE example of how crystal malts in an IPA can serve to produce a drink that is balanced with the bitterness and flavor of hops.

IPA,"Can dated 4/12: 
Pours a classic medium golden and clear, ignoring the chill that adds condemnation to the glass on a humid day. A classic citrus pith and pine, with a little more of the latter, comes out even on a cold beer. At this initial lower temperature, the grain cones out as lightly toasted bread crust backed by a husky to piney bitterness, evolving more towards the classic hop flavor. The beer finished in a classically WCIPA fashion at this point. 
 
The beer gets a little bit of rye bread crust in the aroma as it warms, but a larger amount of pine relative to the colder version. The pine also starts to take hold of the flavor profile, and I’m starting to lose any citrus vibe in either attribute a quarter glass into the pour. 
 
Feel is medium, leaning light (even a tad more so considering the state of IPAs today). Upon reaching what I would call a proper temp, the aroma gains a slight floral vibe pairing with grapefruit pith more than pine. Interesting how it seems to have evolved for me today. The taste also turns a bit pithy in the middle while continuing to finish a bit piney.

IPA,"APRIL 2023. 
Industrial (non-craft) beer, produced for my European market by Heineken (NED). 
It can be found in 35.5 cl bottles and the price fluctuates between €2.60 and €2.90 in local supermarkets (which in these parts are not a sales channel for craft beers). 
Sometimes it is more fragrant and gives a greater sense of freshness, sometimes it seems more stale. 
Even the vivacity of carbonation is sometimes more lively than others, but on average it has a sufficient fizz. 
Not an irresistible scent on the nose in which herbaceous and malt notes are felt. 
Deep golden color, almost orange. 
Abundant foam: soft but persistent. 
Medium/light body. 
Partly malty at the beginning with hints of caramel, then hops take over with a fair amount of bitterness. 
Main hints of resin, citrus and herbaceous (pine needles). 
Dry, fairly bitter. 
Sometimes there is a ferrous note. 
One of the least worst industrial beers, the intensity (medium, but perceptible even after drinking) of the final bitterness is the thing that most distinguishes it from the other industrial products available on the shelves. 
Drinkable, but soulless.",2.72
Ten FIDY,"A black body covered with a two-finger brown 
head assimilates into a pint glass. The head is quite active, and fades in a few minutes, but leaves ample lacing... the carbonation level is good. The smell is absurdly light for a 10.5 ABV Imperial stout. Mostly malt and grain, with a subtle sweetness on the back end. The flavor, however is superb. Coffee and chocolate notes, malt, grains, nuttiness, subdued hops for the style... this beer is finely crafted, and literally wafts across the tongue like waves on the beach, especially as it warms during the session. The high ABV stout category has been somewhat overrun by a faddish movement toward barrel aged brews, and many of them are great beers... but Oscar Blues Ten Fidy is a great example of how good a finely designed Imperial Stout can be in the hands of a great brewer.

Trappistes Rochefort 10,"This is probably the first beer I'm reviewing that you could consider a holy elixir, as Abbaye de Brogne is a brewery located in an abbey in Belgium since St. Peter appeared to Gérard de Brogne, a nobleman who lived around 20 km or so away from the abbey, and instructed the knight to build an abbey to honor God. 
 
That story, allegedly, took place somewhere around 880 AD, making this a very old abbey indeed. 
 
But in 2013, Belgian brewmaster Bruno Deghorain, along with his business partner, Gaby Smet conceived a plan to set up a small brewery in the abbey, with the intent to make abbey style Belgian ales like they did in the days of yore. 
 
This beer, Trappistes Rochefort 10, is part of that dream. 
 
Is it any good? Is this a holy beer? 
 
Let's find out! 
 
CLASSIFICATION: 
 
It's an ale, and when it comes to Belgian beers, there's a few styles. 
 
Here we're enjoying a Belgian Quad, which are rich, strong ales with bold flavors. Typically, they're quite dark in color, hovering around deep ruby reds and browns with garnet hues. 
 
In terms of taste, they're very sweet on the palate, low bitterness, but packing an ABV that will getcha there. 
 
When it comes to beer, Belgian Quads are some of my favorite beers next to stouts. 
 
COLOR: 
 
Caramel, a deep caramel almost as if you left it on the burner a bit too long and it got dark brown. Nice hefty butterscotch colored head that lingers for a long time. 
 
AROMA: 
 
Very malty on the nose, which is the dominant smell that I'm getting. A little bit in the background is a faint hint of milk chocolate. Little bit of caramel and brown sugar. 
 
BODY & PALATE: 
 
Malt and caramel on the palate. There's a faint spritz of clove that I taste. Little bit of a fruity taste that comes in, almost like wine in a sense. I do want to stress it's quite mild in that fruity taste, which I guess is that faint hint of citrus that I'm attributing to these particular kind of hops that they use. 
 
In terms of mouthfeel, it's pretty dense, almost like Coca-Cola in that sense. Very smooth, even for the ABV of 11.6% and fizziness of the beer. 
 
FINISH: 
 
It ends on a Belgian, malty dark chocolate sorta finish. This beer lives and dies by its malt character. 
 
CONCLUSION: 
 
This is a heavy beer that's akin to snuggling up in your favorite blanket and bunny slippers and sitting by the fire. It lives and dies by its rich malty flavor that hangs around. 
 
I definitely do not recommend this beer for a refreshing drink. This is more of an experience, a beer you savor. 
 
As far as holy, well, I'll leave that judgment to those more suited to make that call, as I'm not particularly religious. 
 
But, I bet if Jesus had a signature beer, I bet this would be his beer of choice. 
 
As far as myself, this has shot up to one of my favorite beers of all time, and this brewery became one of my favorite breweries of all time. They're a gem. Only issue though is availability and price. If you can find it, they are pricey, so if you're after a nice beer on a budget, might want to look elsewhere. 
 
But, you definitely get what you pay for, this beer is wonderful! 
 
Until next time... 
 
Cheers!",4.79

Aroma is nothing special, similar to a canned Pelforth Brune. Lots of large bubbles, not as beautiful as Westerverelen or a Guinness. And definitely not a Chouffee IPA or Duvel Tripel Hop. But as the froth reduces, it improves. 
 
The best thing about this beer is the hop aftertaste. It's one of the best mouthfeels of any beer. Really amazing. But it doesn't compare with a Chouffe IPA in terms of flavour for me.",3.18

Taste is sweet, fruity, funky. More bready yeast (or yeasty bread), malty sugars, spice. Old World hops. Some residual grain. A vaguely bitter, clean finish.  
 
Mouthfeel is soft, smooth, full bodied. Reference-level carbonation. Exemplary for the style.  
 
Overall this is still one of my favorite Belgian tripels—La Fin Du Monde never disappoints.

12oz bottle, best before 7/9/12, poured into a tulip. 
 
Golden yellow beer w/ a huge bright white head that defies gravity, leaves behind a beautiful film of lace. 
 
Nose is all Belgian yeast, clean pale malt, and slight alcohol.  
 
Taste is just so smooth. Pale malt, sweet candi sugar, overripe banana, and a slight warming from the alcohol. 
 
Mouthfeel is luxurious, so seductively smooth and drinkable. 
 
Overall, an outstanding version of the style. This beer would be a perfect pairing with so many foods, strong enough to stand up to anything but never dominant. Just a world-class beer that I think anyone would enjoy.",4.34

Abt 12,"750ml bottle into a tulip. Best before 11/1/26. 
 
Magnificent looking beer. Dark brown body with a massive off white head. This is replenished by swarms of carbonation up the side of the tulip, leaving gobs of lacing. 
 
Malty aroma with a lingering sweetness. Also, a faint funkiness. 
 
On tasting, well, so smooth. Abv well hidden. Tons of dark fruit, light sweetness. Takes some restraint not to gulp it down. 
 
Mouth full, finish is where the abv makes an appearance, mixed with plum and raisin notes. 
 
Overall, splendid beer. Cracked this one tonight in celebration of West Ham's triumph in the Europa Conference final. COYI!!!",4.41

Ten FIDY,Gave this beer a try on a whim and I must say that I was beyond disappointed in this brew. The whole thing tasted and smelled of rubbing alcohol flavored stout. A shame really; I enjoy Oskar Blues and this was just a tremendous letdown. Not even worth finishing the can off.,1
Ten FIDY,"First sniff is chocolate, first taste is hops. I'm surprised I didn't rate this the first time I tried it. This is a solid, surprisingly not-sweet, ""What an IPA would like to be"" option.",4.32
Ten FIDY,"Poured black, really black. With a brown head that stood tall.  
The aroma, while not as strong as it would be for most as my nose has been affected by Covid, is still coffee and roasted malts. 
The taste is an amazing balance of flavors; the roasted malts bring the coffee and cacao and dark fruits and the hops provide an edge that keeps the flavor in check.  
The feel is almost chewy, and it seems right for all the flavors that are present. 
This is one of my favorite “pure” imperial stouts, just so good.",4.59

F- Moderate mouthfeel. Smooth with  
a slight tannic bite. 
 
O- An absolutely beautiful Imperial Stout!",4.48
Ten FIDY,Pours black as night. Dark foam. Sweet malt aroma. Heavy roasted chocolate malt body. Coffee and caramel finish. Sweet but not overly sweet. Smoother than expected but you can definitely taste the alcohol. Not for the amateur beer drinker.,4.38
Ten FIDY,"Pours a jet black that forms a moderate caramel head. Dissipates at a slower pace and leaves a good amount of soapy lacing and a nice level of retention on the top. Aromas of licorice, cherries, roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee. Taste is heavy on the roasted malts, bitter chocolate, coffee, and earthy hops. Becomes sweeter towards the aftertaste with a boozy finish. Medium-bodied. A very good imperial stout that is worth a re-visit.",4.33

Ten FIDY,"Purchased at Pennridge Beverage. Perkasie. PA. $16/4pk. 12oz cans 
 
Pours a pitch black, abyss black. A dense but quicky fading beige head on the initial pour. Leaves sticky lacing on the glass after each sip. 
 
Aromas of roasty malts and chocolate. Very inviting. 
 
A delicous imperial stout. Great tastes of chocolate, deep roasted malts and a definite boozy aftertaste. Very drinkable even at a 10.5% ABV. 
 
Very smooth consistency with low to moderate carbonation. Leaves a nice coating in your mouth after each sip. 
 
Overall a top-notch stout. Highly recommended...cheers!",4.4

O - Tasty boozy stout.",4.04
Ten FIDY,"Pours black with a fluffy, sculpted three finger head that lasts and coats the glass with foam. Aroma is roasted black malt. There is a resemblance of coffee as well. Taste is roasted malt, with a touch of sweetness, as if it were similar to a milk stout. However, the black malt is the over-arching profile here. Along with it comes a feeling of bubbles on the tongue at the end of the profile.",4.02

Canned On Date: 26 Nov, 2018 
Consumed on: 25 Dec, 2022 
Glass: Tulip Snifter 
ABV: 10.5% 
Serving Temp: room temp 
 
 
Look:  
Black with a 2-finger high brown head. The head dissipates to a thick ring and cover. Lacing is very good. 
 
Smell:  
Deep and dark roasted malts. Bittersweet chocolate and some faint coffee. Light licorice/anise and a hint of molasses. Earthy and somewhat spicy hops. 
 
Taste:  
An earthy hop bitterness starts things off but is quickly met and balanced by the substantial roasted dark malt notes. Coffee and chocolate (first bittersweet but quickly changing to semisweet) are noticeable. A mild sweetness appears that is a combo of semisweet chocolate, molasses, and faint dark fruits. A quick hit of earth comes back and lingers in through the finish. The sip finishes a shade dry. 
 
Feel:  
Creamy, velvety and viscous. There is a nice warmth from the alcohol. The body is between medium and medium-full (though closer to medium) 
 
Overall:  
A very nice imperial stout that makes a great winter warmer and fireplace sipper. Nice balance and even complexity. 
 
The 4 years of age have had a wonderful effect on this brew. If I recall it when fresh (it has been a couple of years), it was quite bitter and even one note (maybe two notes). Now it is superb. I wonder how it would be at 5 years? 
 
I also wonder if the IBUs have been reduced in more recent versions. I recall either 75 or 95 IBUs for Ten-Fidy, and as I mentioned the brew seemed very bitter to me when fresh a few years ago. OB currently lists the IBUs as 65.",4.18

Ten FIDY,"2022 version - 12 oz can into a snifter at 50°.  
Big tight brown head forms over the dense dark elixir. 
Smell is stone fruit, cacao, anise, coffee, dark roast malt. 
Taste is the same as the nose, but somehow it seems the flavor profile changed from previous cannings. It’s lacking ‘ fullness’ and anticipated bitterness.  
Feel for this batch is less oily and thinner, uptight carbonation. 
Overall, an American Stout classic that’s always a treat.",4.25

Trappistes Rochefort 10,,4.65
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Allowed to acclimate to 50°F (a little too cold, but I let it warm more) and poured into a Chimay goblet. 
 
Pours a hazy carob brown with lighter sediment floating around and a tan quickly dissipating tan head (forgot to pay attention to how tall). 
 
Initial aroma is a slight smell of high alcohol, with a hefty dose of yeast and malt, slight notes of milk/semisweet chocolate wafted around before I smelled it directly. Returning for a second round of smelling I notice a slight note of grass. A third round reminding me of a general whiskey smell. 
 
Initial taste is again, alcohol, followed by malt, followed by milk/semisweet chocolate, followed by light alcohol burn all over the tongue but concentrated in the middle. Third and fourth sips yield raisin and/or generic dark dried fruit notes upfront, as well as revealing a sweetness, similar to the natural sweetness of dried fruit. Sipping after that uncovered a spiciness that comes before the sweetness, combined with the warmth from the alcohol it feels very sensible. I have to admit that for me personally it becomes harder to drink as it warms more because I have a hard time with spirits, and the alcohol in this one is not hidden, but it's still got fantastic flavor. 
 
Mouthfeel is smooth, although a little thin, and the carbonation disappears. 
 
It tastes like a fireplace, super cozy and tastes like home kind of beer. This is the perfect beer to drink while wearing a cotton sweater by a fireplace or a library or den. 
 
It's expensive but it can be justified because it's excellent and has a high ABV. Will absolutely be purchasing again, as well as recommending and purchasing the others in the line.",4.38

Lagunitas Sucks,,4.42
Lagunitas Sucks,"The name sounds like its referring to the brewery, with a bit of self-deprecation, but it's really about 2020. But this beer is the opposite of 2020. It's a dry-hopped DIPA with an abundance of complex flavors stemming from the multitude of grains used in its brewing. Lagunitas really hit the right combination. For a dry-hopped brew, it is a nice crisp bitterness. Checks all the boxes of a solid DIPA with big flavor.",4.18
Lagunitas Sucks,"Pours a gold color with a creamy white head. A little chill haze. It has a medicine taste, maybe because of the ABV? It's very hop forward but not my pint of beer. I like the regular IPA better. It does taste a little like the year 2020, so there's that.",3.39

La Fin Du Monde,"Poured from 12oz bottle to a goblet glass. Look is the color of honey with an off white, creamy head. Very active carbonation keeps streaming to the cap. Smell is spicy and fruity. A good dose of clove and malt. Taste is sweet up front with a blast of clove, honey, and malt. Middle of the sip gets briefly bitter, then hits with some candy apple sweet/tart flavors. Finish is alcohol, more spice and a bit of malt. Feel is medium bodied with soft, plentiful carbonation. That creamy head never goes away and allows for a nice soft mouthfeel. Overall, I am enjoying this beer. I'll be working my way through the sample 6er. This is a nice drinker that I'd have again.

Samuel Adams Boston Lager,"Well, they basically watered down the old Boston Lager, which didn't need any ""remastering"" in the first place. It tastes like the old version except less of everything: not as malty, not as hoppy, less of a cinnamon note.... Just less. I rate it compared to the old version so it's rated a lot less. They are obviously dumbing it down for the light beer drinker, which is a pathetic thing to do.",3.3
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,"Sam Adams Boston Lager, new version, draft at a restaurant dinner in August, 2023. Overall a good beer with dinner. This is the newer version of Sam Adams. It has a good head and lacing; the body is a healthy amber. Flavor has a hint of roasted malt. The aftertaste has a minor pleasant bitterness. I can't directly compare to the ""old"" Sam. From memory, the new one is more to my taste, with a smoother flavor.",3.69
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,"This is the remastered version. Drinking on the national day of Massachusetts in my home state of Massachusetts. 
 
12 oz can acclimated to 46°F and poured into a pilsner glass. 
 
Pours a somewhat hazy, medium amber color, with a 2.5 finger, long lasting, foamy white head, leaving medium lacing. 
 
Initial aroma is heavy on malt and yeast, some spicy phenols coming out. After agitating, the year dominates the foreground, with maybe a slightly caramely quality found hiding behind? 
 
Initial taste before swallowing is a little bland, yeasty with a definite dry floral spice. After swallowing I'm met with a mild hop and malt bitterness, slightly soapy and not dry. Malt is not just bitter, presenting caramely and very bready. Some grainy taste to it. 
 
Mouthfeel is frothy, due in what I suspect is in large part due to the satisfying carbonation. Additionally a little choppy or rough, but not at all bad, it's a lager and it feels like one. 
 
Overall it's a solid beer, not trying to be anything it's not. Excellent if you want just a lager 
 
Likely to buy for the national day of Boston and Massachusetts once a year, but not otherwise, I don't remember how much a single was, but I doubt it was cheap enough to make me reconsider. Sorry Sam Adams.",3.69
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,"It's unfortunate that they felt the need to change this beer as I found it nicely refreshing before. Is it more refreshing now? Maybe, but I don't think it tastes as good. There is a lack of the expected caramel notes and it's a bit too high on the hops and carb for me. Still better than aot of macro options though.",3.27
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,"Anytime you set a standard, you are entitled to change that standard. Boston Lager wants to compete in a bigger market and tweaked their formula. That didn’t immediately make it a terrible beer. It’s a little more hoppy, a tad sweeter, a little more approachable. 
If my airport restaurant choices are Bud Light or Boston Lager.,. well.,.",3.32
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,"Boston Lager was the beer that made me actually appreciate my drink. Before that I would drink anything, but once I tasted Boston Lager something was different and wonderful. Now it's ""remastered"" and it's absolutely ruined... It's still better than some, I'm sure, but I won't be buying any more.",1.72

Samuel Adams Boston Lager,"WOW. I know Todd is old enough to be familiar with the New Coke debacle. No need to say anything else.

Incidentally, best SA beer for my money was Boston Ale on tap.",2.74

Samuel Adams Boston Lager,"Why destroy this beer? I understand that at 50 I am no longer in the hip demographic, but I came to know better beer in my youth through this beverage. Bearded, chubby, 35 year old dudes, that wear their t- shirts a size to small have plenty of options. You could have left one for the rest…tastes like a hoppy Yuengling.",1.12
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,"About 35 years ago SA was my first experience with a “craft beer” after years of drinking Michelob and National I’m hi is Aaron available for Sean? I have a question to you is Sean Davies still here and he is still there is he available? That would be great. I’ll take Sean thank you bye-bye show me the other guy is Premium. I really loved SA for many years but moved on to true craft brews. Last week at a family get together they offered SA. I was anxious to taste this again but was shocked at what swill this had become. The beer looked thin, and tasted of cereal grains. Thought I had time traveled back to Michelob days. Really hope they don’t completely destroy Dogfish Head.",1.8
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,"I haven’t had the non nerfed version of Samuel Adam Boston Lager since around 2008. So it’s hard for me to compare the original with the “Cost Cutting” opps I meant “Remastered” version. But it tastes mostly like I remembered, maybe a bit more watery now though. It’s a mighty fine beer that I’ve kind of been craving more of lately. I just wish since it’s now beer flavored seltzer water, that they’d slash the price a tad bit.

Samuel Adams Boston Lager,"This is like the New Coke or the Star Wars Specialized Edition all over again. 
Why in the world would you mess with the original recipe that is the flagship for your brand? 
The Remastered Sam Adams is OK, I don't hate it but I definitely preferred the original. 
If you want to come out with a new flavor, then come out with a new flavor. Leave the original as is. 
 
With that said, the remastered version is dryer, a bit hoppier, less sweet and less malty. The carbonation is about the same, the mouthfeel is a bit thinner. 
 
I probably won't be buying the new Sam Adams anymore as there are superior options available.",3
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,"The Remaster should be Demastered. The rich, creamy amber of old has been replaced with a more bitter and dry, lite ESB. I’m halfway through my 1st 12 pack. Wondering if I can make it to the end…..

This beer isn't available in may area but his friend from out of town had left them and he let me try them. HOLY COW! I was blown away that a pale ale could be so complex.

60 Minute IPA,I tried this beer a very long time ago as well as the 90 minute imperial IPA. For some reason the brewmaster at Dogfish Head thinks their IPA's need to be more and more malty. The 90 minute used to taste hoppy and now it tastes completely malty and toasted. Now the 60 minute version is ruined. Can't figure out why these beers started out very hoppy but are now malt dominant. The brewmaster is an idiot in my opinion. These beers aren't horrible but they are not at all what they once we're. The BM can go screw himself in my opinion. He must not like hops or something stupid like that. Screw him!,4

Pale Ale,"12 oz can acclimated to 49°F and poured into a nonic pint. 
 
Pours a nice clear copper with a 2.5-3 finger seafoamy, barely off white head, leaving little leaving. 
 
Initial aroma is caramel malt, a little pine, and really nothing else. After agitating I kind of just get a general grainy smell. Smells good, just simple. 
 
Initial taste before swallowing is very sweet, with a cereal grain undertone, and a dry hop presence. After swallowing I get more of all of the previous, with the hops being bitter and dry, and seemingly growing in bitterness as I enter the aftertaste, it's not terribly bitter, but the intensity is high. 
 
Mouthfeel is smooth, and goes down easily. The carbonation fades somewhat quickly but can be conjured for a short duration through agitation, it lends a pleasant creaminess through its small bubbles. 
 
Overall it's solid, just simple. Limited flavor notes, in addition to a smooth mouthfeel, but a relatively strong bitterness make for an ale that's easy but not too fast to drink. Would make for a good beer for when you want to not think, or when you want to think. Want to turn your brain off? Drink something simple. Want to think about something? Drink something that doesn't require much thought. 
 
May buy again, not something I would go out of my way for, though. If it's cheap I'll consider it.",3.57

Enjoy By IPA,"Appearance: 
Translucent, pastel gold. Proffers up two fingers of finely minced froth that’s white as an untouched snowcap. Modest retention gives way to sudsy, webbed lacing. 
 
Bouquet: 
A mango, pineapple, peach smoothie rife with tangy Citra and bright, tangerine-sweet Amarillo, woven together with slender strands of earthy Mosaic. 
 
Feel: 
Full-bodied and thick with hop oils, the texture is given a much needed third dimension by a boisterous, peach fuzz carbonation. 
 
Taste: 
A huge chomp of just-ripe, yellow mango topped with shreds of candied orange peel. Then, lemony Citra and the tropic sweetness of Amarillo rise like flowers from the distinct, new earth flavor of Mosaic hops. Concludes on a long, low, afterburn of hop bitters and sauvignon blanc.",4.53

Stone IPA,"Chill haze orange gold body with a sticky white head. Nose is orange and grapefruit pith and zest, some fresh pine needles, and a hint of spice. There's a bit of a sweet malt backbone to the beer that wasn't obvious to me in the nose. It seems a bit more than I recall from having this over the years, but the can has a date that puts it at a month old, so it's not that. The citrus note melds into the malt, weakening its pop compared to the nose. Pine comes through with a little more power to make up for that, although it isn't as fresh - more like the pine needles have fallen to the forest floor. Still a solid IPA, but it isn't as brash as I thought it once was.",4.05

Arrogant Bastard Ale,,3.98
Arrogant Bastard Ale,"Look: Pours a deep shade of amber with a generous, three finger head of beige foam that has excellent retention and laces the glass very well. No visible carbonation. 
 
Aroma: Sticky toffee and caramel, bitter grapefruit peel, spruce needles and toasted orange peel. A touch of sweet/funky guava. 
 
Taste: Upfront, treacle and sweet tamarind. Quickly transitions into moderately bitter notes of flambéed orange and grapefruit peel. Ends on rich notes of bitter tree resin and spicy spruce needles. 
 
Feel: Full bodied and velvety. Very low carbonation. Silky smooth and creamy. Alcoholic heat profile is very mild, but somewhat detectable, I wouldn't call it boozy but you can definitely tell it's not a light weight beer. 
 
Overall: I've had this beer many, many times but haven't had it in a while. It's much better than I remember. Would highly recommend to anyone who likes their west coast IPAs and hasn't tried it yet, or any veterans who may have not had it in a long time. Definitely a world class imperial IPA / ""strong ale"".",4.55
Arrogant Bastard Ale,"Poured in standard pint glass. Nice ample, fine sustained head. Very bitter, slightly boozy when straight from the fridge. Did not enjoy, had to walk away. Allowed to warm slightly but still cool, had a more pleasurable experience. Prominent bitterness was accompanied by greater complexity of flavors including leather, wet tobacco, faint hint of dried fig. Well-suited for a cool Spring day post-yard work.  
 
A beer I would prefer not to eat a meal with, but rather enjoy on its own when in the mood for something strong and different. Never got to enjoy the barrel version. With its name; likely a victim of its own success, but as with a once fantastic bottle-conditioned bicycle beer, it happens. At least this beer still retains its general character and is not simply concerned with appeasing the easy-drinking masses. Still memorable for a first-timer. Not a go-to by any means, but will not hesitate to drink again on occasion.",3.72

Pale Ale,"Poured from a 12-oz bottle into a pint glass. 
 
Appearance: Orange-ish golden in color; large creamy barely-off-white head that lingered long, leaving abundant lacing. 
 
Nose: Pine, with a slight hint of floral. 
 
Mouthfeel: Light-medium. 
 
Attack: Lightly-toasted malt, grassy citrus; the tiniest bit of caramel provides depth. 
 
Finish: The hop bitterness comes through strong, but not too aggressively. 
 
Overall: I must admit to approaching this beer with more than a bit of reverence, honoring its status as a long-standing statesman among craft beers. I’m not a hophead, so neither pale ales nor IPA’s are my “go-to’s.” This beer, however, is worthy of its status, and is an ale I’d be proud to serve and drink with food pairings that scream out “pale ale!”",4.02

Overall- Pale amber and mildly hazy with average head retention and lacing. Bouquet was malt forward with notes of pine and grapefruit. The flavor followed the nose well and was medium in strength. Feel was medium body with moderate bitterness and highly creamy. Overall this was a solid pale ale that provided a nice drinking experience, but other than mouthfeel it was only slightly above average.",4.07
Pale Ale,"Finally leaving this one a review after all these years... 
 
Pours pale with some hints of orange, slightly off white head, OK retention but always great lacing when poured semi aggressively. 
 
Nose is an aromatic combination of light floral with some pine mixed in, the malt is nicely present; very very lightly toasted in nature. 
 
Taste is nicely hoppy and balanced; a very nice malt ever so lightly toasty backbone that carries all the pine and grass from the hops. 
 
Light to medium body; very pleasing carbonation, it has a softness too it; finishes with a dry and piney bitter and grassy bite. 
 
The balance of this beer is always impressive to me, it has a unique malt presence and pairs so nicely with the hops.",4.4

Nose is rich in roasted aromas, dark chocolate that carries some fudge aspects, espresso, strong hop presence as well; adds to the perception of incoming bitter flavors. 
 
Taste mostly mirrors the nose, this beer is dark chocolate and espresso but it carries a chocolate richness to it as well; the finish is very hoppy, pine and rind like in nature. 
 
High end of medium for body; it has a luscious creamy feel to it, super smooth on the palette and a big kick of bitter american hops on the finish...the roast also adds a substantial bitterness as well. 
 
I don't really drink stouts but I do drink this beer because it is perfectly balanced and just overall amazing to sip on.",4.48

Two Hearted IPA,"12oz can with date code 062823. Served in a pint glass. Bit coppery color, orange amber, with a thick white head. Very nice start. Old school AIPA aromas of citrus and maybe some pine. Really substantial mouthfeel owing to a solid malt backbone with some crystal malts along with a creamy load of carbonation. Maybe even oats in the mash? But anyway, this is an IPA, and it brings along a very reasonable level of bitterness and piny goodness. Makes me think of Dogfish 60 minute in terms of flavor profile, turned up just a little bit, but not as far as 90.

Feel: Nice full boy, low carbonation (the feel of this beer might be my favorite thing about it) 
Overall: Pretty crushable, fairly tame, nothing too offensive. That being said, nothing stands out, but I suppose you could also say that just means its well balanced. Not my cup for IPA's, but good  
 
*poured from a can on clearance that ""expires"" in 4 months, so I def think this needs a revisit with a fresh brew.",3.1
90 Minute IPA,"Pours an opaque rusty orange, thin collar of head with good retention and no lacing. Nose is sappy hops and malt, low grade maple syrup, cooked barley and kasha, honey sticks. Taste essentially follows - malts are sweet (honey, maple, sap), while the hops impart a pretty tame bitterness and light spice. Mouthfeel, despite the sweetness and heft, isn't too heavy, while the carbonation stays light. 90 Minute tastes like an ingredient to me - it has a distinct taste (sweet, spicy, sappy honey) - that might make up the main seasoner in a muffin or a sweet bread. On its own, however, it's a little too overpowering to be enjoyable. I remember 90 minute being this huge outlier when it came out, and weirdly, it still is in terms of its flavor profile among imperial IPAs.",3.11

Beer poured a hazy light golden orange with an okay white head. 
 
Nose is very nice, citrus and tropical fruit forward. 
 
Taste is a light but substantive pale malt base that allows the hops to shine thru and that they do. Very flavorful with orange, papaya, and mango shining through. Finishes with a touch of grapefruit and some major pith; 7/10 on my bitterness scale. 
 
Mouthfeel is ultra-light and very refreshing.

Pours a clear orange amber colour with slightly tawny coloured head that replenishes nicely with a little swirl. 
Nose is at once hoppy with citrus rind, tangerine, a touch of tropical fruit and floral aroma , but solidly malty with a subtle caramel note. 
Taste is a barrage of hops - piney, citrus, orange, pineapple and marmalade with a bitterness that is tamed by the sweet toasted malt with hints of caramel and honeysuckle. 
A sticky slightly resinous full mouthfeel finishes this with a coating bittersweetness.",4.59
90 Minute IPA,"Easily my favorite imperial IPA and possibly IPA period. 
 
Pours a beautiful crystal clear amber color with a tan-white head that long persists as a rim. 
 
Aroma is very strongly floral and earthy. 
 
Despite being rated as 90 IBUs this is not a bitter beer thanks to the adequate amount of malt being added to balance the hops. The flavor is citrusy and earth with a crisp finish, making this an easy drinking beer despite its high ABV. 
 
Really just the ideal poster child for the style of IPAs as a whole.",4.81

I had the OG Ghost In The Machine early last year, and while I enjoyed it quite a bit, I found the hop burn to be a bit of a problem with it. A DDH version sounds like it could make things even worse on that front, but this is a highly regarded beer so I had to order it when I saw it on Tavour. Let’s crack it open and see what it’s all about 
 
Pours a hazy milky yellow with 2 fingers of soapy off white head that quickly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing 
 
The nose is aggressive here, but it’s aggressive in a great way that does not suggest hop burn. I’m picking up on aromas of overripe cantaloupe, pineapple juice, orange juice, bready malt, grassy hops, dank weed, white pepper, and a touch of caramel 
 
And unfortunately this one also gets a bit too aggressive in taste, but I’m still enjoying it. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting earthy hops, orange juice, dank weed, overripe cantaloupe, bready malt, white pepper, and light pine. The swallow brings notes of earthy hops, dank weed, orange juice, overripe cantaloupe, pithy grapefruit, bready malt, pine, pineapple juice, and an odd hint of gasoline 
 
A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes mostly dry and bitter because of the hops burn, but it eventually settles out 
 
I really wanted this one to be better than the original, but it’s really about the same. A bit less hop burn leads to a greater drinkability, but the odd gasoline note prevents me from bumping up the taste score",4.34

Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,"DDH Ghost in the Machine pours a hazy, golden color with a fluffy white head that leaves behind a beautiful lacing on the glass.  
 
The aroma is incredibly inviting, with prominent notes of tropical fruit, citrus, and pine. The double dry-hopping process really shines through in the aroma, with a depth and complexity that is unmatched. 
 
On the palate, the beer is just as impressive. The first sip is bursting with juicy hop flavors, with mango, passionfruit, and grapefruit dominating the taste profile. The bitterness is well-balanced and not overpowering, allowing the fruity flavors to shine through. There is also a slight sweetness to the beer, likely from the malt bill, which provides a pleasant balance to the bitterness. 
 
The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with a medium body that coats the tongue and leaves a pleasant aftertaste. The carbonation is just right, providing a refreshing bite without being too fizzy. 
 
Overall, Parish Brewing Co.'s DDH Ghost in the Machine is an outstanding beer that deserves all the accolades it has received. It is a beautifully crafted IPA that is both complex and balanced, with a flavor profile that will please both hop-heads and beer novices alike. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a top-notch IPA experience.",5

The sweetness notes in the nose after a swirl pervades the opening through to near the finish, reducing the contrast, but taking the bitterness I enjoyed in the back end of a colder beer.

It is a clear, reddish plum pour with half a finger of pure white head. It looks less thick than many of the HF saisons I have tried, but ""prettier"". 
 
Tart plum bursts from the bottle and fills the room. As I pour it gets even stronger. My salivary glands fire before I even put nose to glass. Such a delicious aroma, it calls, entices, with fresh plum, tart sourdough, raspberry jam, grape must notes, honeysuckle, hints of spicy alcohol and fresh flowers, in perfect balance to create a stunning aroma. 
 
All the flavors of the nose are here, no need to repeat them, balanced perfectly, in a wonderful blend. It ends a lightly jammy whih fades into a tart, fruity linger. As it warms hints of an herbal bitterness enter the mix, quite lightly, and it gets even better. 
 
Medium body for style, light carbonation which works well here, clean as a whistle, with a brilliantly flavored linger that is just right to bring on desire for next sip.

Now I must say, this is quite quite good. Like very good. Somewhere between a good stout and an aged whiskey, which isn't a surprise based on the drink itself. That being said, it does not exemplify the thing I like most about beer so far being, drinkability. I do like the refreshing nature of a beer quite a bit and that is the only thing I'd say is absent here.  
 
At 14.3 percent, it's quite high for a beer, and you feel a lingering alcohol taste towards the end. It is accompanied by some sweet notes like date and chocolate though.  
 
Mouthfeel is very unique in that somehow the bubbles feel thick. Like the consistency is buttery and but the bubbles feel heavy for some reason bringing out a very odd and unique, but not off putting, almost soupy texture. Mouthfeel end notes are sticky and also a little velvety or caramel-like.  
 
Smell is a little sour and very malt forward, slightly fruity and even slightly-er herby.  
 
If you haven't tried it, I highly recommend. I've been sipping as I write this and am appreciating it more and more. One hell of a beer. If you do grab one, the only thing I can say is that it's not smashable, but should be enjoyed slowly.",5

Heavy maltiness and bourbon character, but still incredibly smooth with very little burn for the ABV. Raisin note is slightly present in the back, as well as the faintest banana peeking through once the malt onslaught begins to fade. 
 
Feel: Thick but only slightly oily on the palette, light but lingering carbonation. Sticks around a bit, but in a pleasant way and doesn't overstay its welcome. Very slightly syrupy. Really pleasant. 
 
Overall: Masterclass of an imperial stout. Has more distinct flavour impressions than most stouts with adjuncts, but is still perfectly balanced. Deserves the hype.",4.86

Breakfast Stout,"I love coffee. I love stouts. I love oatmeal stouts. I usually love coffee stouts. Given all that, I expected to love the #2 oatmeal stout in the world according to the current ranking. Unfortunately, I didn’t. The coffee smell is above average, but the taste is overly bitter and mostly just reminds me of bad coffee that was roasted far too long. This one is not for me.",2.73

Breakfast Stout,"Poured from a 12-oz bottle into a pint glass. 
 
Appearance: Very dark brown, nearly black, with a dark tan head so thick that it required multiple gradual pourings to prevent overflowing the glass. Moderate lacing. 
 
Nose: Dark roast, stone fruit, brown sugar, coffee — there’s a lot going on here. 
 
Mouthfeel: Creamy, moderately thick. 
 
Attack: Dark roast, coffee, chocolate, smooth — plenty going on here, too. 
 
Finish: Alcohol, and bitterness from the dark roast that balances everything wonderfully. 
 
Overall: It’s hard to imagine how an American Oatmeal Stout could be any better than this — so full, smooth, and well-balanced. There’s nothing I’d rather drink with Biscuits and Gravy, but it’s also going very well this morning with goetta and scrambled eggs. This beer deserves every bit of its high ratings.",4.75

Atrial Rubicite,"A: Bacterial degradation on the collar, which quickly inches in stature until the hasty retreat. Despite that, a constant longevity to the brim, providing a categorical aptness. In the interim, a trivial exposure on the collars cling, which substantially decreases through the periods. The appearance off the decant comes to a sangria to pansy purple dye, while highlighting pompadour to the carafe, as the vessel (on transfer) missions a bole tinge. On-top, an alabaster cap that brims to a link white per the aforementioned. The coloration presets get stretched on the discharge, as a way to represent a semi-transparent elegance 
 
S: An earthy introduction with a relaxed awareness on esters, as the microbial contagions adhere to the vintage. Confident components to the aged-oppressed raspberries through a matured involvedness, from a ripened oldness to an oxidative mephitis. Howbeit, a calculated fetor that’s initially repressed, as the draw comes with an hourly aridness. With this mind, the presetting notations reap the aggregates, of an array on drupelets ascribing raspberries. The symbolism stretches to a Clafoutis complexion, while remaining seedy and rooted to the additive. All the while, an implication to ethyl hexanoate, where the apple correspondences meld softly to the phenolic spin-offs. Such bonuses speak to the loitering spices found in eugenol, while complimenting the framework over the adjacent ketone (C10H12O2). At no cost, a wet – woodsy – hop effect that lends a resin kindness to the leafy tannins, aside the peppered herbaceous rearguards. The bacterial agents on lactobacillus are present to the caducity, while evolving a Camembert refinedness thru the employed (bottle) conditioning. Sequentially, a more captivating element on the native drivers, which offer a nuanced mustiness to cattle sheds, amid a smirched growth on Stinkhorns 
 
T: The virulence is perceptible on the cellared acidity, which comes with a well-bred dryness, for yeast explicitness. Nonetheless, a raspberry opulence to not be overtaken, yet an accessory that now parallels the implied draws on clingstone peaches & citron lemons. Markedly, an isoamyl octanoate nexus to the structure, which is supportive to the grains on rusticity. Assuaging hops provide a herbal kick to the eugenol compounds that touch on clove, when pitching resin to the concourse. The age welcomes a pastoral fondness with a vanilla oak consideration to the tannins on berries, as an acetate solvency crawls behind. A movement that expresses abandoned bunker silos, while airing farmland mildew on rabbity phenols. Moreover, an Alpaca wool note that corresponds to damp cattlehide, as a decanted nuttiness formulates aside moldy caverns. Oxidation comes sequentially with an elevated solvency on epoxy, while setting up Sangiovese commonalities. Correspondingly, a move in time that’s deftly degassed, as dry leather nears tobacco, when bordering burnt guaiacols 
 
M: An alleviated sweetness that’s pitted against acidic motorists, which is aeriated intentionally to strategically stabilize. There is a minerality factor that resembles an autumn jog with a soft mist, while tannins support an attenuated dry rider. In this situation, the approach inaugurates a bright vivacity that doesn’t pierce, but rather respects the framework, as a soft texture grows upon the weathered advancements 
 
O: The vintage has an acerbic presence that’s regulated thru wild yeast auras. Phenols that assist esters in an involved growth, while malts gently circulate a toasted granularity. Chiefly, one with an operative uniqueness to the raspberry add-ons, as a bacterial exsiccation maps out",4.38

The smell is very reminiscent of whiskey due to the barrel aging. Slight alcohol tinge, but very fruity and sweet smelling. The smell is like raisins or figs. There is a slight fermentation flavor that reminds me of wine, likely due to the high ABV. 
 
The flavor is very sweet and low in bitterness. The flavor is extremely malty, and fruity. The taste seems like a cross between a high malt beer, a wine, and a bourbon. Notes of figs, raisins, trailed by syruppy molasses and fermentation flavors. 
 
The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy.

Atrial Rubicite,"2020 vintage (Blend 10/April 2020); consumed on 7/31/2022 
 
Pours a stunningly vivid, blood-red hue sporting deep ruby highlights along with a short-lived finger of fluffy, soft magenta foam; a few islands of paper-thin cap are temporarily encompassed by an equally thin collar and minimal-no lacing holding to the walls of the glass with any longevity. 
 
Aroma is awash in fresh raspberry jam as silky vanillins underscore a gentle funk; wisps of Sangiovese impress an increasingly juicy red grape must, while oaky, lacto-funk evolves in turn over time. 
 
Taste brings raspberry jam cut with a level lacto-funk upfront; red Jolly Rancher is eased with subtle dry oak imparting red wine tannins and subtle minerality over the mid-palate and into the back end, where musty, wet basement undertones are interspersed along the finish. 
 
Mouthfeel offers a medium-light body with a subdued, moderate carbonation; a glossy lacto-cooling washes waves of funky brightness over the palate, while a tannic wetness lingers on the back end, drying quietly into the close. 
 
Jammy raspberry reverberates through a tannic silk and soft, funky underscore, leaving a wild ale perceptively hybridized by waves of dense fruit saturating rustic subtleties; a playfully approachable complexity throughout.",4.4

L - Pitch black, with a one-finger tan head. Head goes away after a few minutes or so. Fantastic lacing. 
S - French-roast coffee, with chicory. Heavy notes of bourbon, oak, and dark chocolate. Hint of black Cavendish pipe tobacco. 
T - Follows nose. Rich burnt sugar. Halfway through the glass, this brew evolves into a something else! Notes of vanilla, cacao, french-roast coffee, and chewy caramel. Hinting at fig, cherry, and raisin. Finish is long-acquired; leaning sweet, with a velvety oaken tobacco. 
F - Full-bodied, with little carbonation. Viscous, but not syrupy. Velvety. Dense. Strong. This one is a sipper for sure, and it'll warm you up! 
O - Another fantastic brew from Goose Island. While I wouldn't say it's worth the price in the slightest, it is a must-try. Funny enough, the ABV isn't detectable; I didn't realize how strong it was until I peeked at the label halfway through the glass! A delightful & decadent end to a chilly evening.

Maman,"Pours jet black with a still, no foam look. Heavy oily legs cling to the glass after the lightest of swirls. It looks like motor oil that's been run hard through a motor for ten thousand miles - thick, dark, and viscous. Aroma pushes dark fruits, plum, and chocolate across the nose first. Char, barrel, bourbon, and hearty roasty and toasty malts sit behind. Dark fruits is the dominate note, at least, immediately out of the fridge. Mild brownie shows up as the beer warms. Flavor profile is dark fruits, caramel, toffee, tobacco, raisins, fig, plum, and chocolate. The blend of notes conjours up thoughts of barleywines, but retains heavy stout notes via late roasty and toasty malts. Bourbon, barrel, and char are all present to varying degrees, molding into the 14.6% ABV well. Brownie and more chocolate start to show up as the beer warms, masking some of hte initial dark fruit notes. It really develops a wonderful depth to the flavor profile after a fairly simplistic aroma. Mouth feel is thick and viscious, but with an otherwise flat and still effervescence. Overall, a blend of hearty stout and barleywine notes. It has a lot of dark fruits for a heavy stout, but despite that, retains a good balance despite being in wine alcohol territory. Massive slug, so -0.25 from overall.

Alright folks, here we are, the final BIF beer I received from @Eziel! It’s been a wild 6 months of hard to find beers, and we’re ending with the heaviest hitter of the bunch. This is currently the 5th highest rated Saison on BA and 52nd overall. Those are some impressive stats. Also, I’m not sure if I’ve ever seen a beer fruited with only nectarine, it’s usually a blend. Let’s get into it 
 
Pours an opaque orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that very quickly fizzes away to nothing and leaves no lacing 
 
Sheesh, less than stellar appearance aside, this is bold in the nose, just super fruity and tart with a big funk too. I'm picking up on aromas of sweet nectarine, wet hay, tart apricot, sharp oak, lemon yogurt, wildflower honey, straw, and crackery malt 
 
Oh man, the funk is even punchier in taste, but not in a way that's out of balance. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting tart peach, lemon juice, white wine vinegar, stone, sharp oak, nectarine, wet hay, honey, and lemongrass. The swallow brings notes of wet hay, stone, white wine vinegar, peach pit, nectarine, sharp oak, crackery malt, lemon yogurt, and light orange juice 
 
A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a sharp and zippy beer. Finishes bone dry with a lovely balance of sour fruit and funk 
 
Wow, this is one hell of a beer! It's highly complex, yet I could chug it. But why would I do that? I plan on nursing this bottle over the course of the night",4.51

Doubleganger,"Poured from a can 3 weeks from canning into a Willi. Very aromatic on the nose - very tropical with a mango and citrus.  
Similar notes on the palate, with just a foamy pillowy balance that Tree House is known for. Very mild bitterness. There's nothing different here. Definitely one of their better offerings. I'd love to just have a four pack of this in my fridge at all times. Just a top notch NEIPA.",4.54

Doubleganger,"Nice and hazy. Two finger head that dissipated in a short time. Some lacing. I was interrupted after pouring it. So I may have to have another and reevaluate the “look” aspect of this beer. Great smooth fruit, hoppy flavor with kind of a syrupy finish. Treehouse makes great beers, and this is one of their best.",4.68
Doubleganger,"Canned 8/15/22. Purchased 8/16/22 at Charlton. 
 
L: Pours a hazy deep gold with a white fluffy head with big bubbles. Pretty and irregular lacing. 
 
A: Aromas of mango, peach, and tangerine. More complex as it warms. 
 
T: Follows the nose beautifully up front, then a surprising hop punch - with no burn - in the middle. Finishes dry but not too bitter. 
 
F: Soft mouthfeel. Medium carbonation. Pleasantly sticky and resinous aftermath. 
 
O: This is a typical Tree House tropical/citrus delight until the mid-palate hop jab sets it apart. Not necessarily better than the standard offerings, but a bit more distinctive.",4.54
Fuzzy,"I'm finding I am really enjoying white peaches specifically in wild ales, just lend themselves to barrel, funk and botanicals so well. Here SP has done well to allowing the juicy peach tones shine too. Smell is damn impressive: sour peach, yogurt, barnyard, and barrel funks, bright and rustic oak, pressed flowers, dry earth, a touch of lemon and lime zest, and finished with big hay. Taste is more sour and less complex with funk losing the barrel variety to the sour fruits, otherwise the same with sneaky complexity yet potent. Feel is sour and decently acidic, but gentle, dries out with various funks, almost feels more pungent than it tastes or smells. Clear yellow body with a pinky finger of white foam. This is right up there with the best peach wild ales, little less acidity and it could be the very top",4.55

Fuzzy,"2022 vintage 
 
Here we are, the #1 Wild Ale on BA for my 1500th review! This is a special one that has been a long time want for me, so I’m very excited to finally try it. I’ve only had a few Side Project beers, but they’ve all been fantastic so I have no reason to think this one wouldn’t be. Let’s get into it 
 
Pours a cloudy pale gold with 2 fingers of whitehead that quickly fades to a ring and leaves no lacing 
 
This is certainly tart in the nose, but it has a surprisingly nice balance to it. I'm picking up on aromas of tart peach, lemon yogurt, sharp oak, tannic white wine, straw, bready malt, wildflower honey, apple skin, light vinegar, stone, and even a touch of smoke 
 
In taste it starts off with a balanced tartness similar to the aroma, and on the back end explodes with an aggressive flash of tartness before settling down once again. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting jammy peach, lemon juice, vanilla, wet hay, straw, smooth oak, leather, and white grape. The swallow brings notes of tart peach, lemon juice, crabapple, white wine vinegar, sharp oak, wet hay, vanilla, bready malt, and light peat smoke 
 
A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a puckering beer. Finishes a tad sticky but dries out over time 
 
Oh yeah, this is damn good. Despite the not so good looks, everything else here is awesome. A truly unique beer",4.49
Fuzzy,,4.22
Fuzzy,"Appearance - The beer was the color of a peach. It was orange with red hues toward the center.  
 
Smell - The beer smelled like sour peaches. There was an undercurrent of sweetness, like vanilla.  
 
Taste - The profile was quite acidic, like a soured peach. Notes of peach and peach skin were detected. There seemed of be the presence of vanilla sweetness as well. The profile had a nice sour peach finish.  
 
Mouthfeel - The body had little carbonation, but a pleasant smoothness.  
 
Overall - This is a sour that I can enjoy, and I am not a sour guy.",4.42

Fuzzy,"This was a guest beer on tap during the 2021 Zwanze Day celebration I attended. 
2020 Fuzzy, at a year’s age. 
 
Loved the nose on this. Stone fruit in season, white peach and a hint of funk. It’s tart, without being overly sour, with a nuanced finish. More of the peach notes, leaving the palate tingling. Fantastic.",4.57
Fuzzy,,4.73
Fuzzy,"A: Tangerine pour with fiery hues to apricot. The neck films a shade of macaroon cream that’s dismissive per inscription, from the preset retention. Howbeit, an irksomeness to turns offers lace docility, as the intervals thermally protract. There’s a touch of transparency upon the settlements of course, while effervescence becomes a mobilized variance  
 
S: Pierced rusticity for white peach with esterification authorities. Illustrated by, a bitingly tart eruption that’s tamed enough for the developing – wild yeast – appearances. The progression opts for some grainy malt to the motivated horsed phenols, which quietly idle funk steps. Principally, satchels and farmstalls with soiled mold. Nonetheless, acidity is tenacious on fruit bouquets, as the lactic stability is detrimental to frowzy quirks. There’s elements of solvency thru the open air drafts, which incriminate nail polish and naphtha agents. On the other hand, that piece is often stupefied, given the peppery phenol attunement to floral hops, and biscuit-y malt brackets to stone fruit minerals 
 
T: A clean, consecutive, punch-down stomp that puts natural peaches in vanguard. Notations subtly follow in ripening depictions of Goldrich apricots and Armking nectarines, while briny minerals perimeter Neptune grass. In correlation, an engine for Eugenol to promptly pump in cloves and nutmeg, while maintaining that peppery attenuation. The ongoing drive is earthy and persistently bright, with calming acidity on the advances of rural funk. To that end, the move adds haystacks atop the citrus connotations, but keeps that musty jazz in a distant place. Aerial attacks begin setting in, from oak dragged elasticities, and prompt in some leathery satchels. Whilst, Chardonnay attenuates a staleness for Budapestlängd with an oxidative nuttiness 
 
M: Does not puncture with puckered acridity, but rather maintains a level of energy that rationally aids. Namely, a backend for rustic brettanomyces, and a pillar for biscuit-y grains. The approach is brisk in carbonation, as the approach is crisp in sensation. Thus, cleanly bright with minor overextensions in the presetting bites, but pleasingly uplifting in the dry – erosional – reliefs 
 
O: Showcases clean peach natures with a caustic effervescence that’s costly to the preliminary entwines, of wild yeast. Though, development is rapid enough to calm the impaling authorities, and make rational moves. In this situation, light malts provide an aid to earthy hop kicks, while acclimating spiced esters with musty phenols. The approach is thereby tart with brett funk complexions, and spurs wooded fruit tannins on an astutely dry/crisp exhibition",4.15

Ann,"2015 batch, which I think is batch #3. Bottle pour from Hill Farmstead Brewery in Greensboro, VT. 
 
This one pours a fairly clear golden orange color, with a small head, and a bit of lacing. 
 
This smells like lemon peel, tea, honey, grassy funk, white wine, pear skin, melon, Riesling, and a minerally funk. 
 
This is my biggest white whale, the beer I have most wanted to try since first trying Hill Farmstead originally 10 years ago. It’s tremendous, just about as good as it gets for saison, but, it wasn’t even the best beer I had from Hill Farmstead on my recent trip. That’s how high the bar is for this long-time favorite brewery of mine. This has soft, subtle, and richly complex flavor to it. There’s the obvious honey, almost like honey-soaked pears, or something like that, with white wine, Riesling grapes, melon, apricot jam, and a floral and minerally funk. All of these flavor descriptions make it seem like it’s a super strong and intense beer – it really isn’t. It’s really delicate, and rewards slower sipping and enjoying. 
 
This is light bodied, soft, almost creamy, with a wonderful drinkability. It’s well carbonated, but in a subtle way. 
 
This might not be the exact top of the mountain for Hill Farmstead – that’s probably Samuel, or one of the SARA Residency beers. But this is pretty close to the top, and a perfect expression of an already great beer in Anna.",4.84

Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Purchased a 2023 bottling in 2023. Poured at cellar temperature into a wine glass as my goblet did not survive a move. 
 
Vigorous head on pour half filled my glass with fluffy, off-white foam like a well-made cappuccino. Excellent retention and it took a long time to settle enough to pour a proper glass. Beer is a ruddy brown with tawny highlights. Some haze and fine carbonation. 
 
Immediate malt on opening, like walking into a bakery. Warm, whole grain type bread. Putting my nose into the glass, my impression is of balance. It's subtle and difficult to pull out specific notes, but I get cherry, a bit of almond, orange peel, and a light mineral aspect. The expected regional notes of banana and clove are present but subdued 
 
Taste is the expected clove and banana, plus brown sugar, cardamom, cream. Back notes of coffee beans and mineral water. 
 
Mouthfeel starts out with a Sprite-like effervescence calming to a velvety, creamy texture from the head. 
 
Drinkability? Yeah, it's drinkable. If you can get ahold of enough of it to have a session, sure, you could do it. But after only one bottle I can already tell I'm starting to miss subtleties that I picked up at the beginning. Much more affordable beers to tie one off with. But for any Beer Advocate, this is a bucket list item worth checking off the list.",4.41

Beaming pale gold, with hints of orange color, and some fine carbonation. Soft creamy top of finger presented, with an off white appearance and bowled tilted lacing. 
 
Aroma is a wonderful spiced orange. Juiced Christmas mandarin nose, with hints of spice and leafy green sensing hops. Soft bodied and creamy vanilla sensing malt to match make an impressive hop nose. 
 
Palate is richly good, but no surprises. Creamy sensing body along with the flavors, if anything its mouthfeel is the most impressive. Mid palate rich in peeled and juiced orange tangerine notes. Finish accentuates soft green herbs, to an almost minty finish but a more pungent flavor, and sharper astringency like a soft pine. Still manages great balance keeping soft vanilla like flavored sweetness, and that classic Creamsicle orange like flavor.

Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Drank this is a Belgian beer cafe in Warsaw Old Town a few years ago, so reviewing from memory. It was definitely kind of expensive, but not as expensive as I was expecting. On a cold, snowy, lonely night...it seemed the perfect idea. 
 
It definitely looks as beautiful as any beer I have seen. Deep, dark and mystical. And I remember the aromas being similar...deep and mystical...and complex. 
 
I remember it being mega smooth. My initial impression was that this is much better than Rochefort 8 and 10. Much much better. As I have never been a fan of either. This has much more complexity, and is less creamy...and kind of dark and full of different flavour sensations that are difficult to put into words. However as I am reviewing from memory, I will need to review again when I actually have one with me when I am writing.  
 
So yes, this is kind of a vague review, but I don't remember liking it more than a mega amazing West Coast IPA, or even a Chouffe IPA. It was kind of like a Chimay Bleu but wth much more complexity. So these ratings are my approximated memories. Ciao",4.17

Actually drank this about a year ago with two friends I was sharing bottles with. We did a side-by-side with St Bernardus Abt 12, long my favorite Quad. Although I've left alone my ridiculous scoring of that one (from around 20yrs ago) as it was an amazing experience for me at the time, this actually was the superior beer. I just score a lot more realistically these days, compared to when I was a NOOB and whose mind had just been blown by my first Quadrupel Ale.",4.61

Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Such an amazing beer! The ""Westy"" is the Unicorn of Beers. I bought 48 Bottles (2 crates) at the Abbey in Dec 2017. Still have about 15 bottles left. Its been interesting experiencing them age over time. They are still drinking well, but IMHO I think they peaked after about 3 years. 
I did a side by side tasting party in 2019 including beers from all 6 Belgian Trappist Ales (Westmalle Dubbel, Chimay Bleue, Rochefort 10, Orval, Achel Brune, Westvleteren 12(St Sixtus Abbey), and others (St Bernardus 12, Leffe Brune, La Trappe Quad). Many of these are excellent, but the Westy 12 was head and shoulders above the rest in terms of overall complexity and quality. I agree with many of the tasting notes posted before and I wouldn't do it justice to try, but I will say if you enjoy the strong quad style do yourself a favor and try one.  
 
OBTW I had to call and hit about 500 busy tones before finally getting through to a Monk and placing my order in 2017; and I had to go in person to the Abbey to pick them up. I believe they now have a website that you can order for delivery. Check their calendar for times and details.",4.94

Stamped on cap “24.10.15”. Served at 53.4 degrees in a hand washed and dried Tripel Karmeliet chalice. The final temperature was 59.7 degrees.  
Appearance – 3.5.

Body – Amber Brown (SRM 18), opaque. Under direct light, same coloration but loaded with precipitate and suspended particles. When rear lite, opaque except amber at the edges.

Lacing – None. 
Aroma – 4.5 – Roasted malt, dates, and figs, sweet candi sugar, no yeast, no hops. No ethanol (10.2 % ABV as marked on cap) aroma.  
Flavor – 4.5 – Roasted malt, dark fruity, slightly sweet. No hops, no yeast. Weak gastric warming. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl.  
Palate – 3.5 – Medium; lightly creamy initially, thins as it warms; lively carbonation.

Chestnut/burnt umber liquid with copper/caramel highlights and a small beige cap receding quickly to a lasting collar. Adequate retention; fine lacing; delicate yet viscous legs. 
 
Lovely rich malty/estery aromatics suggest plum, fig, date, toffee, and an old European cobbler's shop. Weighty yet perfectly integrated and inviting. No perceptible oxidation. 
 
Flavor follows the nose but is joined by a low earthy bitterness and some suggestions of brandy and eucalyptus. Long, linear, medium-dry finish. Rounded and rich with some complex stewed fruit elements.

Beer 1400!!! I purposely saved this one for this landmark review since I reviewed the base version and the imperial version a few weeks back. This has been a long time want of mine, and luckily I was able to get the whole series at once. This bourbon barrel-aged variant has been sitting at the highest rated Imperial Porter for a long time on BA, and #38 overall. Let’s see if it lives up to the hype 
 
Pours a very dark brown with a finger of creamy dark tan head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing 
 
The bourbon is definitely present in the nose, making the whole thing quite a bit sweeter but still really good. I’m picking up on aromas of sweet bourbon, charred oak, salty bacon, medium roast coffee, milk chocolate, maple syrup, burnt caramel, and light brown sugar 
 
It’s an absolute smack in the face of every single element in taste, wow. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting smoky bacon, milk chocolate, maple candy, sweetened coffee, sweet bourbon, raisin, toasted oak, creamy vanilla, and caramel. The swallow brings notes of salty bacon, charred oak, dark chocolate, medium roast coffee, burnt caramel, brown sugar, maple syrup, smoked malt, and vanilla 
 
A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a smooth and silky beer. Finishes mostly dry with a warming alcohol presence

Poured into Durobar Charente glass. 
 
Appearance: black bodied beer with dense and thick off white to light brown head that is uneven with lots of large soapy looking bubbles. Light lacing. good staying power. Thick ring remains around the outside of the glass as the head eventually dies down.  
 
Smell: Big maple and oatmeal with a hint of cinnamon, smokey bacon and a hint of coffee. Hints of chocolate, oak, and bourbon. 
 
Taste: Immediately big maple syrup flavored oatmeal just like what was found in the nose. Bacon and meaty smoke integrated nicely with a gentle ashy barrel char in the middle that is quite enjoyable. Hint of Dad's brand root beer candies and cola. Finish has lots of rich bourbon notes and chocolate notes. This is complex, superbly balanced, and flat out really really tasty. Easily exceeds my expectations for sure. 
 
Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with low and adequate carbonation levels. Slightly silky and creamy bodied porter. Very smooth and not any booze at all.  
 
Overall: Finally! Pretty excited to get to tick this barrel aged porter thanks to TATURBO. This beer is rich without being overly sweet. The barrel notes are spot on and it really is hard to find anything wrong in this beer. Just the right amount of maple which is a flavor that is easy to overdo. The balance is also quite impressive as well. Put this beer on your must try list if you haven't. Breakfast flavors galore with a splash of bourbon and oak. What's not to like? The barrel aging definitely improves maple bacon coffee porter which is a hard feat to achieve. Nice work here from Funky Buddha for sure.",4.59

Feel -Lower carbonation, minimal boozy sting and a lighter body than expected.  
 
Overall - Great beer that I feel privileged to try. I couldn’t drink many of these in one sitting as they are pretty rich but a very enjoyable beer everyone should sample.",4.74

Parabola,"Firestone Walker Brewing Co. ""Parabola 2015"" 
$10/10 oz. on tap @ Falling Rock Tap House, CO on 6 October 2019 
 
Notes: Labeled at 14% ABV. Very dark brown-black body beneath a short head of tan. Malty in the nose with notes of dark malt, Bourbon, roastiness, charred oak, vanilla, and coconut. The flavor is intense. It's malty, sweet, and a touch ""hot"" from the alcohol with notes of coffee-like roastiness, Bourbon, milk chocolate, dark chocolate, plum, molasses, charred oak, caramel, vanilla, and coconut. It's full bodied on the lower end and remarkably smooth and creamy. There aren't too many beers like this one.

Parabola,"Poured from the bottle into a cool tulip glass. 2023 vintage. Consumed at approx. 50 degrees F. 
 
L: Solid, jet black. Very slight desaturated brown head. 
S: Strong sweet chocolate nose, a bit of something like caramel and even some coconut. A bit of booze. 
T: Dark coffee and chocolate brownie, not terribly sweet. Again, something akin to lightly toasted coconut flakes. Surprisingly there seems to be some more acidity than I was expecting. Big boozy finish. 
F: A bit lighter than expected, but still fairly heavy. Slight carbonation. Moderately warming. 
O: A brighter stout than I was expecting, but still fantastic. Just the right amount of warmth, and plenty of rich, dark and sweet flavors to play with. One of the best stouts I've had.",4.69

Parabola,"2021 Vintage. Pours a very dark cola brown, half-inch tan collar of head that leaves wisps of lacing. Nose is big on whiskey and rye, along with wood, vanilla, char, licorice, molasses, brown sugar; aromas really gel and round at as it warms. Flavor is equally complex - lots of spice from the rye, sweet molasses, wood, Canadian whiskey, light vanilla, sugar in the raw. It manages to avoid becoming an overly boozy nightmare while still highlighting the spirit barrels, all without loading up on sugars and adjuncts. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, though not so much as BCBS; there's also some light carb as well. Pretty exceptional.",4.55

Parabola,"L: Poured from a 12oz bottle into a sniffer - Jet black pour with a decent head appearing. About 3 fingers length to be exact. No lacing left behind as the foam dissolves back into liquid form. 
S: Getting a sweet bourbon cherry aroma from the first sniff, can definitely smell some coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and oak in there. Very well done on the nose! It hit all the marks that they advertised and it was very noticeable/ well balanced. This deserves a 5/5 for me. 
T: Tasting bourbon, cherry up front as the nose indicates. Getting some big coffee, chocolate, vanilla and oak as the nose followed. It's rare the nose is tasting the exact same in a similar order to the nose. 
F: A good sipper - easy to sip in my opinion, full bodied, medium acidity.  
O: I can see why this is a world class beer. this big 13.5% beer showed us what we can expect on the firestone walker website and this is exactly what we got. I tried to look for more flavors and one can argue it can have some dark fruits but I would say it's pretty rare a beer company hits it spot on and actually tastes good. Good job firestone, I applaud you for this one.",4.83

Parabola,"2022. It didn't taste like a Russian Imperial Stout to me, too sweet, in fact I think Rasputin is a better representative. And forget about comparing it to Sam Smith's RIS. I was thankful the bourbon still came through strong which did a lot for the taste. I think the most noticeable things about this beer are its ABV of 14.1% and it's ""weight"", both of which put it in the one-and-done category...and that's if you can finish the 12 oz bottle, which I was barely able to do after about 2 hours from the time I poured it. The ABV and the weight really work against the enjoyability of this beer.",2.9

Parabola,"Drinking a 2017, which I've had in the cellar. I am not an expert on the true evaluation of the RIS but I fell in love with this one after my first trip to Firestone/Walker in El Paso de Robles about 12 or 13 years ago. This started me on RIS style. F/W have a cellar room where you can buy the good stuff. I recommend a visit, as the wine country out there is fabulous and F/W is affiliated with many of the wineries (sourcing casks, mixers, etc). The beer is complex and has so many taste notes to it that I won't try to guess them all. It should satisfy almost anyone. I highly recommend putting one away for a few years. I have a few more. Tonight my wife is celebrating her 60th, and I will be having a 5 year old Deschutes Abyss or two after the Tomahawk Ribeye BBQ tonight. But for now, nothing better to set off this great celebration than my all time favorite, Parabola!",4.63
Parabola,"2021 vintage 12 ounce bottle, poured at 53° into a Firestone Walker snifter. 
Perfect brown head rises above a deep black sea and leaves a nice ring inside the glass. Drizzly lacing. 
Smells wonderful - dark malt, chocolate, coffee, prune, licorice, barrel char. 
Drinking like a millionaire. All of the aromas spill forth into the mouth and everybody takes a bow. Multiple barrels makes for a taster’s experience. The peppery spice of the rye barrel carries long, which helps cut into the sweet elements of this Russian Imperial Stout. Vanilla. Fudge. Barrel.,. on and on. 
Feel is not overly dense, which I appreciate. Medium carbonation. 
Overall - World Class Stout and totally worthy. The art of the craft!",4.65
Lou Pepe - Kriek,"Seeing the tape get pulled off the menu listing for the 2020 bottle at the Cantillon bar definitely got the old heart pumping. As the freshly, horizontally uncorked bottle rested in its lambic basket, it began to slowly push a soft mauve foam out of the spout before I gave it a tilt to pour a damn near smoothie-like stream into the glass. There it displays fully opaque garnet with a dense cotton candy head. 
 
I said St. Lam was the juiciest Loon? Scratch that, this is like Schaerbeek puree with mild hints of cinnamon marzipan delivered on a pillowy body with a surprisingly balanced acidity. Even still, a complex oak tannin brings us to a bone dry finish before exhaling a touch of black pepper and perhaps chevre. A delicious candied quality further emerges as it warms. 
 
I'm not sure I ever imagined just what made LPK the highly coveted fruited lambic that it is, but clearly, that distinguisher is decadence. This is undoubtedly the thickest lambic I've ever had, and in all the most delicious ways.",4.94

Lou Pepe - Kriek,"Cradled 750mL bottle served in decanter, sat for ~20 minutes, then served into glass. Pours a rich burgundy color with a finger of pink foam. Aroma is cherry forward, but not in a fleshy, fruit forward way, instead delivering a rindy dark pit. It's morphs into notes of almond and cinnamon, with light tart cherry and stone just beyond. Complexity is notable, without any overtly sugary tendencies. Flavor profile delivers those same almond and cinnamon notes. Cherry is present, with a tart twist. Stone, followed by big lemon zest and grassy notes play the outro. Again, the complexity and depth is just amazing. For a beer blended with cherries, it develops much more nuance and thought beyond this single note. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a consistent grit throughout. It verges on bubbly, at least at the onset. Overall, cherry notes here are just a delight, swirling together with almond and cinnamon for a thought provoking sip. It refrains from every dipping into overtly tart or sour.

Aroma has tons of funk, well complemented by complex wine and barrel noted. along with lemon & dandelion. Overall a wonderful smelling beer.  
 
Taste picks up right where the nose left off. I get apricots, wine barrel, apple vinegar, lemon, hay and general barnyard funk. Acidity is spot on. Tart, but it doesn't beat you over the head, allowing all the other wonderful flavors their time in the spotlight. Light bodied, bright, crisp and clean.

Morning Wood,"Damn, the minute I opened this I was punched in the face with maple - it is clear that age has not diminished the maple presence at all ... In terms of appearance it pours a shiny black color. A lovely velvety head forms on the beer with solid head retention. It is pretty viscous. Back to the aroma - it is dominated by the maple syrup with underlying notes of smoky bacon, oak, bourbon, and chocolate. All of those aromas are quite strong - so I am not really getting much in the way of coffee. 
 
Taste follows the nose and is very much dominated by the maple syrup flavor, but the surprising part is that it is not at all as sweet as I remember from having this in the past. There is much more roasted malt, chocolate, smoked malts with some slight meaty notes, and the bourbon barrel comes through more strongly. Some slight roasty bitterness comes through on the back end. Feel is thick, full bodied and luscious. Moderate carbonation. Sort of drier on the finish.",4.53

Billed as 'An American Double IPA' on the label, this beer is nowhere near as intense in flavor or feel like so many others. Instead, there is a respectable balance and nuance at work. The drinkability of the beer if pretty phenomenal. There is nothing harsh or brash about the taste or mouthfeel, just glorious smooth and tasty vibes of the hazy-persuasion.

Double Sunshine,"Poured from the can into a Lawson's branded tulip/goblet glass. Canned April 26th 2023. 
 
Beamin juicy orange colored body, with a touch of haze and light visible carbonation. Three finger forming head, a bit of soapy and big bubbled appearance which pops easily, with light retention. Still manages to stick around and leave a tall collar as well, making a nice crowned appearance. 
 
Delicious aroma. Hop pressing front nose with light citrus, and faint touching juicy tropical notes. A nice creamy touch almost sweet vanilla, mixing with a light caramel and crispy malt quality. Comes off like hinting of light powdered sugar on fruity pancakes quality. 
 
The mouthfeel on this is just unreal. An intense solid backbone that is creamy with just a light touch of pushing sweet tones on the palate. The mid hits with thick THICK controlled orange and pine notes, mixing sweet cream and orange, and pine/earth heat. Bitterness comes in the finish, so ever slowly, with first notes of tangerine and Christmas spices, then with lingering notes of pepper and wood bitterness. Campfire like warmth in the back palate, that just slowly sits and churns with all the orange and spices you can imagine.

T: Grapefruit and sweet malt dominates the beginning, the hops come into play by this point and play very nicely with the grapefruit. These dank, citusy notes do not overpower and keep the beer tasting fresh. It finishes clean, especially for a DIPA. 
 
F: Nice level of carbonation, feels smooth and finishes clean. Incredibly drinkable for a session. Just be careful with DIPAs with this level of drinkability. 
 
O: Incredibly well balanced DIPA with an excellent flavor profile. This might be my favorite DIPA I have tried to date.",4.85

Hopslam Ale,"Here's a hot take: I don't think this is a good beer. Perhaps I got a bad batch last time, but it just didn't have the flavor profile I'd expect from a beer that almost cracks the top 250. The honey seemed to reduce the supposed ""Hopslam"" down to more of a ""hop nudge"". This meant any flavor complexity seemed to disappear as well. In this case, I think the high ABV is also detrimental as it tastes very alcoholic, and therefore heavy. Too bad, 'cause it's a heck of a value at Costco.",3.48
Hopslam Ale,"In a flight at British Open Pub. Oh my goodness. Complex and over the top in all the tight ways. A strong hops palate but also a strong malt backbone. Kinda boozy, but it's New Year's Eve.",4.28
Hopslam Ale,"Poured from 12oz can to a tulip glass. Look is fairly clear burnt orange/amber color with a foamy ivory head that takes a while to fall to a nice cap. Sits pretty still in the glass. Smell is pine, melon, caramel apple. Aroma is present but not powerful. Taste is pretty sweet up front with a hit of cantaloupe and citrus. Middle gets a shot of bitterness, but nothing too bracing. Middle sees more fruit flavor like apple and citrus. A bit of pine hits in the finish but it's balanced by a floral, honey sweetness. Balance is a key characteristic here. Aftertaste is apples, caramel and honey. Feel is medium bodied and smooth, smooth, smooth. A low carbonation pops up, but boy this is easy to drink. Overall, I should have tried this years ago, but balked at the price. This is tasty, balanced pretty well between hop bitterness and malt sweetness. Way too easy to drink given the 10% abv. I am a fan of this one though.",4.55

Julius,"Poured from a can into a teku glass 
Appearance – The beer pours a very hazy orange color with a big puffy head of off-white foam. THE head has a great level of retention, fading very slowly over time and leaving tons of streaky lace on the sides of the glass. 
Smell -The aroma is big of a musty grainy and bready smell mixed with lots of raw hop aromas of a herbal and earthy nature. There are other citrus aromas of orange and tangerine as well as hints of grapefruit mixed within. Notes of apricot and some grass are in there as well, giving a rather raw and sorta green smell to the brew overall. 
Taste – The taste starts out drier than one would anticipate from the nose. It begins with a mix of bready and cracker malt flavors combined with hop flavors of a very potent herbal and grapefruit hop. Notes of a floral and pine hop flavor are there as well, but these tastes are light in comparison to the herbal hop. All the hop flavors are rather “raw” in nature, having an almost hop pellet like flavor associated with them. These potent flavors are the dominant ones throughout much of the taste. While said, there is a decent showing of fruit flavors of tangerine, peach, and apricot, as well as a hint of mango. The mix of sweet, bready and hop take the taste to its end, where it leaves one with a rather green hopped and slightly fruity and malty taste to linger on the tongue. 
Mouthfeel – The body is a bit more on the creamy and chewy side with a carbonation level that is on the more moderate side. For the rich hop and malt flavors the feel is well done and makes for a nice easy sipper. 
Overall – A very nice brew overall. I think I like this better than the King Julius as it is more approachable from my standpoint, but hits all the same high notes as the king variety. Big and flavor and drinkability with a nice blend of hop, malt, and fruit.",4.44

Assassin,"A: A carbon black discharge to the carafe with a tap shoe hue, while the decanter rests on a woodsmoke tone, before the radiance pins a coloration near Kurotobi. The transfer(s) occur across natural nucleated sites, which avoids the unwanted lipids/impurities on the cross-reactions, for solidifications. Accordingly, a collar formation to the inch, as latticework – marginally – pushes through a rushed retreat. The brim comes in towards the .25in, which clings to the periods that reach 1cm, while the hours further the detachments per the foam-negative materials. With this in mind, the palette to the neck has a dark beige peak, as the rushed retreat has a mars brown rim. In turn, a viscosity factor that plays to the annulling properties aforesaid, which support the nuanced droplets that attune the advanced (teary) arches  
 
S: Malts frame the dexterities above a soft hop bill, while the oak casks work to build a complicated mass around the aged aldehydes. An ignition that politely connotes La Bête Noire with a Cajeta glaze, as figgy duff pairs alongside prunes + flame raisins. There is an oak stave to plank presence in exercise, which adds a dynamic balance to the sweet midsections. Supplementary to this, a calm hop effect that reinforces the barrel toned landscapes, when symbolizing forested alder to shagbark hickory. All the while, a ventilated deduction on the vintage, beyond the bettering cask aspects. This comes at a trained interval, which nears ≥68°F, for softening & blooming the – hourly – abstractions. Correspondingly, an enlightened (smart) complication that comes without additives, where the stability is maintained & rooted through coordination. The progression optimizes the breathing periods, by characterizing Palo Cortado through rawhide over clay pipes, outside the dried fruit subtexts over Atomic Fireballs. Moreover, a structure that continuously engages in complex polymers, when denoting lignins across tannins, in the act of rolling dry constitutions  
 
T: Soft barrel entitlements to the conversions set by diastatic enzymes, where hemicelluloses contribute to the cultured caramelization(s). Namely, maltol developments to the plot, for signifying doughy accounts on Nussbrezels under a Crème brûlée guise, as bourbon coats Chelan cherries + Moyer plums. The notations have a light implication on the makings that analog MalvaBons, while lightly addressing the oak lactones thru coconut. The age offers a refined sense on the phenolic aldehydes, as they lend vanilla by vanillin, which comes with a molasses – charred – nature. Howbeit, cautious to not exceedingly burn amid the oxidized transfers, across the carafe, where Fahrenheit gets incrementally pushed. There is a leathery standing behind the hydrolysable workings, which offer a steadying composure to the sweet malt passages. This is furthered by a low toned bitterness, when detailing the dark rosin inflections. Sequentially, a blooming allowance that recapitulates the sensed perceptions on sherry, where an oxidized nuttiness supplants English toffee. The sequences have dry – tannin derived – cessations, while carefully regulating spiced eugenols & smoked guaiacols, against the softly spoken (developed) acetaldehydes  
 
M: An intensity behind C₂H₆O that’s courteous to not suffocate, when attenuating sweetness. Thus, a treacly to thick mitigation with an alleviating bite, while the smooth ebullitions amalgamate over the tempered – carbonated – tiers. A feel that’s accompanied by age, besides the aeriated drafts, for paving a weathered maturity  
 
O: The degradations on hemicelluloses are rich in their pursuit on furfurals above ethyl acetates, which is fittingly appropriate, for perceiving malt. Oak compounds are continuous in the upsurge, of clocked intervals, as they are paired alongside the relaxed wooded hops. Correspondingly, a construction that offers more harmony, when providing the time with an uncapped patience",4.46

Double Barrel V.S.O.J.,"Phenomenal. Poured cold to a Glencairn glass. Dark burnt caramel color, minimal fuse-fast head. Aroma is unexpectedly heavy prune with a base of leather and light vanilla. First sips are laden with bourbon bite, I mean a heavy hit of hot but enjoyably sweet spirit. The barrel wood is forward, bringing images of saturated staves oozing booze and tannins. I don’t even know the ABV but it’s easy to kick back a big swig…though I only have this one lonely can to enjoy. Mouthfeel is full, with a nice stickiness. The caramel bites are all over the middle and end flavors. It carries traits similar to a stout/barleywine cuvée, like Anchorage’s Endless Endings, wherein there is a dark malt middle flavor once the sip is gone and you’re enjoying the linger. I also find it similar to Fremont’s B6K, but with a much more subdued and harmonious sweetness profile. Next time, I’ll try to get a 4-pack.

JJJuliusss!,"Its with a jaw tightening, lip smacking, mouth watering series of sensations that gives Tree House's power packed Julius a newer and juicier life that'll leave us stuttering for more. 
 
The excellence in Jjjuliusss is felt starting with a similarly creamy peach and golden blend of colors and airy textures as the original Julius. The beer's dense and foggy appearance only works to make it more appetizing. A slow separation of ale from froth suggests a viscous character that carries over to an even more creamy, tangy, sweet and fruity taste just after a grassy, citrusy, herbal and piney perfume than any before. 
 
Less grassy and herbal in taste, the flavors that explode on the middle palate are dominant with all-things-orange. Tangerine, in all its tangy, fructose-sweet, branch-ripe and fresh squeezed vibrance springs to life with a zesty support of red grapefruit, lemon and lime. Tantalizing tropical fruits join the taste with pineapple and kiwi nuances. Smooth in the beer's fleeting taste, a sense of bitter sherbet with citrus zest apply their final and lasting contributions to balance. 
 
Creamy and malty-dry, the taste starts fuller and plush, but trailing bitter, herbal and dry, the soft sappiness of freshly shaven spruce links up with fragrant citrus peel for an evaporative texture and a nearly teeth-churning creamy tartness that aligns itself with sorbet desserts- Its surprising that a single sixteen ounce can can hold so much flavor.",4.52

Anabasis,"A: A zinnwaldite brown discharge to the carafe with a Fisher Cat disguise, as the highlights near a Ruddy Duck tint. The stabilizing agents on the collar lack the hydrophobic polypeptides to substantiate; nonetheless, they are attuned to the design through brevity. As such, an output that has a Cassava toned neck, and a Roman Mushroom hued rim. The latticework suffers from the negative – appropriate – materials, but there’s a residue leeway using gentle agitation. This necessities at the launch, which is hastily cut inside the minute(s), as a new nuance defines the drippy – cathedral – windows 
 
S: The blend plays to the barrels with an accompany netting over the malts, while thickly layering esters atop hop sanities. Chiefly, a presence on acetates that pushes a solvent characteristic above the finer points, as they struggle – against epoxy – at the outset. Nonetheless, an oak derivative that midriffs on furfurals, which benefit the grain bill, by advancing the sweet caramel notations around Colomba di Pasqua. The road has a Rabitos Royale cusp with a cherry cordial prompt, as sultanas devise Boerenjongens. Moreover, a chord on orange blossom honey, which pursues a robust earthiness, while transmitting coniferous woodlands. This simulates treks covering Douglas Fir & Scots Pine trees, while natural Copal resins air above. Subsequently, a balmy increment to the hour, for attuning burnt sugar toffee to the skins of grapes, as the schedule concatenates on ethyl hexanoates. Namely, aniseed upon sundried apples, while the cask to malt ratio encompasses an oak plank grit on Moravian Wafers. The ventilation across the clocked periods delivers caved Moscatel congruities, which meld Raisin Marmalatas into eucalyptus shrubs. In due course, a @ > 80°F that sticks an aridness on guaiacols over beeswax, while a meerschaum presence stains vintage – vinylon – coats 
 
T: An isoamyl octanoate shadow to the deeply drawn hemicelluloses, where the oak structures pitch lipid derivatives. There is a solvent continuation, which is calmer than the odors let on, yet a paint to wood varnish – remnant – remains over the initial records. The direction incorporates Daim bars to German nougat sweets, as Vínartertas concoct. Underneath, a drawing on teakwood, by a deciduous nature, beyond vanilla agroforests. Secondly, a recognition – of the diastatic enzyme conversions – that benefits the malt saccharifications over maple crème caramels, while drawing on Peruvian coffees. There is an earthy hop poise to the residual sweetness, which lends a woodsy bite to the course. In doing so, the blend advances without choking, and furthers the development behind acetates, as tied to the cask enhancements. A development that’s constantly subjected to the °F upticks, as open air addresses the carafe, for an oxidized maturity outside the porous wood doings. In this situation, the process provokes vintage Armagnacs, where peculiar leathers top candid fruits, besides dated mink boots against flue-cured tobacco. A continuation that hints at shabby – masonry – chimneys, while phenolic compounds deliver eugenols over the charred lactone sentients 
 
M: A texture that delineates a sharp bite across barbed resins, which imbalances the kick-off. Coupled with, tannin constitutions, for elevating (& refining) dry executions against a soft glutinousness. As such, a dexterity with a sensitive viscosity through a warming decree, yet careful on the inebriant malaises, as carbonation brings a soft effervescence. The output lends a harmonic bitterness with a greenery balance, by the phased hop pillars  
 
O: Emphasizes the 26mths to 19mths with a warm barrel perceptiveness, which is slightly furthered outside the necessary transfers, considering a start that battles to make inroads. A blend that has a robust grain bill, where temperaments platform in steps, as reconciliations take place on the divergences",4.02

Chemtrailmix - Rye Barrel,"Putting a little pep in your step and numbing the senses all at once, 3 Floyd's pink peppercorn and cinnamon Dark Lord variant takes this Imperial Stout to the nuclear level.... and with snacks. 
 
Jet black and pouring like ink, Chemtrailmix alerts the nose with a strong, savory and sultry blend of coffee, cocoa, whisky, spice, port wine and sherry. As the inky elixir hits the tongue, the taste is enlivened with the sweetness of brown sugar, blackstrap molasses, toffee, honey and caramel with hints of chocolate and condensed fruit. 
 
As the stout extends across the middle palate, the sweetness slowly turns to dry. A rise of espresso, baker's chocolate, roasted nuttiness and campfire char keeps the session hefty before the spices of cinnamon and peppercorn tease the palate with a gentle dry prickle. Trending warm with rye whisky and oak, the late palate trends coconut-like with vanilla, earthen grit and caramel with those savory aged port and sherry savory qualities. 
 
Full bodied, pleasantly chewy and off-cloying, Chemtrailmix finishes malty-dry, spicy and very warm. With impressions of sherry and coconut lingering in aftertaste, this calls for a long, patient and sipping session with high rewards and a surprising rate of drinkability if you can tolerate the combination of whisky and spice.",4.52

Chemtrailmix - Rye Barrel,"Pours a pure, coal black color with a sudsy dark tan head that is fairly quick to flee. The nose features the cinnamon up front and with extreme prejudice - this is bigly cinnamon. There’s also a nice spicy note from the peppercorn and some chocolate and a subtle barrel note. 
 
The barrel is more pronounced on the taste, and a perfect, spicy complement to the peppercorn flavor - and the still bigly cinnamon, which is delicious. There’s also chocolate and a surprising bit of stone fruit. There’s a LOT going on here and it’s all magnificent, IMHO.

Taste takes it a step further: honestly SP's best non-fruit wild saison, if not their best saison period. Add passion fruit, pear, and a whisper of grapefruit to the fruit from the nose, oak is now toasty and bright, vinous kiss adds layers in a gentle way, floral tones are more generic compared to nose though, must and funk elevate.

A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,"Anchorage Brewing’s A Deal with the Devil Double Oak-Aged Barleywine is an extraordinary beer that left a lasting impression on my taste buds. The combination of its rich double oak aging and complex flavors creates a truly remarkable experience. The aroma greets you with notes of caramel, vanilla, and subtle hints of bourbon, setting the stage for what’s to come. 
 
The taste is where this beer truly shines. The double oak aging process imparts a smoothness that is both velvety and warming. It boasts a perfect balance of malty sweetness, dark fruit flavors, and a delicate touch of oak and bourbon. As it warms up, the complexities further unfold, revealing layers of complexity that keep you intrigued throughout each sip. 
 
The mouthfeel is luxurious and full-bodied, showcasing the craftsmanship behind this beer. The finish is long-lasting, leaving a pleasant aftertaste that beckons you to take another sip. 
 
While this is certainly not an everyday beer due to its higher ABV, it is undeniably a treat worth savoring on special occasions or for those seeking an indulgent experience. Its bold flavors and well-crafted profile make it a standout among barrel-aged beers. 
 
Whether you’re an avid beer enthusiast or simply looking to try something exceptional, Anchorage Brewing’s A Deal with the Devil Double Oak is undoubtedly a top-tier choice that I highly recommend. Cheers!",4.91

Pours the deepest of dark browns, no head. Bourbon and leather on the nose masking some almond and perhaps also some dried fruit. My partner says Twizzlers, and I can see that too. Under the omnipresence of bourbon, I get raisin, brown sugar, then cola and fig on the finish. This is good albeit a little sweet, which does make it hard to get to completion, if you are drinking this on its own, which if you spent a lot of money on the bottle, you are probably feeling this way.

I've finally arrived at the illustrious A Deal With The Devil series. I have not had the base beer, but I recently came across this and the Triple Oak-Aged version. Considering this is review #1599 for me, I wonder what I'll choose for the milestone review #1600...Let's get into it 
 
Pours a cloudy dark brown with just a finger of tan head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing, but with fantastic legs 
 
The nose here is very sweet, but in no way overbearing, with much of the sweetness coming from dark fruit notes. I’m picking up on aromas of fig, dark chocolate, sweet bourbon, vanilla, black cherry, burnt caramel, charred oak, cognac, molasses, light port wine, and toasted walnut 
 
It keeps up the sweetness and the balance of said sweetness in taste despite some seriously boozy notes that come through, and somehow improves upon it. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting molasses, sweet bourbon, brown sugar, raisin, toasted oak, vanilla, smoky tobacco, sticky caramel, light coconut, plum, and a touch of port wine. The swallow brings notes of black cherry, plum, port wine, burnt caramel, cocoa powder, raisin, sweet vanilla, charred oak, earthy bourbon, walnut, and the slightest hint of fusel alcohol 
 
A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a slick and boozy beer. Finishes mostly dry and seriously complex, and the booze actually works really well here for a perfect mouthfeel 
 
This is awesome. I'm not sure it's worth what it sells for, but who cares? It was great to get to try this nonetheless. With the second highest rated American Barleywine behind me, we all know what's next",4.54
A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,"This was supposed to be a legendary Barley wine. It was also a very expensive barley wine. Maybe my palate is not developed enough to tell the difference between this and other BA barley wine's. 
Look: Typical caramel color 
Smell: Toffee, dark fruit 
Taste: Follows he nose 
Feel: medium body 
Overall: I gave it an overall rating of 4 due to the price. I just can't justify $100 for a 12 ounce bottle. One and done for me, not worth the price.",4.3

Fundamental Observation,"2022 vintage (batch 8) served in my Bruery snifter. Pours one shade shy of black. Complexion is opaque. Head ins loose and mocha-colored and quickly disperses into a tight band around the shoulders and an oily slick across the surface. Nose is decadent vanilla, caramel, cocoa and spirits. This is going to be decadently sweet! Taste follows nose - spirits are subdued and only come out at the finish. The rest is just pure candy. Mouthfeel is medium in body with a semi-still carbonation. Overall, an amazing imperial stout.",4.44

Beer opens chocolate, vanilla, and fudge. Hints of cocoa powder and roasted malt. Big barrel overtones. More vanilla and molasses in the finish. Body is full with low carbonation. Sticky and viscous on the palate and goes down warm with a long, lingering, sticky aftertaste.

Fundamental Observation,"Received from a generous person in a NBS BIF back in 2020 and split with a friend soon thereafter. This is from the notes. 
Pours the color of strong coffee (""Stout Black"" I like to call it) and is light blocking dark in the glass with just a little walnut hue on the edges. The deep brown head is inviting and slow to dissipate. 
The aroma gave me vanilla first, bourbon second, and the menagerie of dark fruits, chocolate, coffee, wood, char that make up the malts contribution to the smells. Very nice, if a little more vanilla than expected. 
The taste was solid. The vanilla, so heavily featured in the aroma, was first on the tongue, followed and overwhelmed my the coffee-chocolate-dark fruits almost cake like in effect; not sweet exactly, just decadent (if that makes any sense) The bourbon was in the swallow, terminating the pastry party effectively. 
The feel was a viscous pleasure. For such an ABV I like something with heft, or body - to sip and savor, not quaff down like some AAL. This nicely fits my preferences almost perfectly. 
Would love to try again, but glad I got to try it at least once.",4.68
Fundamental Observation,"Received from the ever-generous @turkeysdrinkbeer in August 2022, and drunk in May 2023.  
 
L: Thick, jet black. Utterly still. There's a thin coat of rusty, coppered-coloured foam atop the glass.  
 
S: Umami roastiness, booze, vanilla, dark chocolate, cocoa, and ethereal spirit notes from the bourbon. Surprisingly, this didn't change much as the beer warmed.  
 
T: Vanilla and bourbon notes dominate the initial swallow, and then a wave of booze crashes over the top, burning throat, tongue and larynx like a good RIS should. There's a tangy hit of malt and then a retronasal whack of cookie dough settles in and lingers long. Warmth settles in the stomach and a medicinal sweetness slides in after the cookie dough fades. There's an excellent balance to this beer - there's no danger of cloying sweetness, nor is there so much stickiness that wasps begin to hover expectantly around my head.  
 
M: Mouthfeel is thick and unctuous - there's minimal carbonation but it suits the beer well. As noted above there's warmth seeping lazily through my body at the halfway mark of this one, and it settles deep and comfortably, like an old, familiar couch. 
 
O: This is an enjoyable but intense beer experience. There's no likelihood of a second beer after you've spent an hour or so in the company of this beer, but the size of this beer means that's not a problem.

Fundamental Observation,"I had both the 2018 and 2019 vintage. This review is for the 2019 vintage. The 2019 is not substantially different (going off memory), although I think the body (mouthfeel) is a little thicker. 
 
Surprisingly, at 3 years this beer hasn't lost much (any?) vanilla, although refrigerated most of that time.  
 
The best part of this beer is either the taste or the smell. The nose is loaded with what reminds me of buttercream icing - with a hint of something else. Perhaps the alcohol that you get off vanilla extract. The taste is similar, but the buttercream on the taste is more of something you have to use your imagination for. It's the essence, but not direct flavor. Lots of deep, fudgy chocolate. A bit of alcohol on the back end, which is unusual, but I suspect is a result of the interaction with the vanilla. While tasty, I wouldn't say that the taste is complex. 
 
Nothing exceptional about this beer, but it is very good. I think that my score accurately reflects how I feel about this beer and what I think it is deserving of.",4.23

Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,"This is the 2022 vintage with Burundian Turihamwe coffee blend from Intelligentsia. Poured from the 16.9 oz bottle into an imperial pint glass.  
 
Look: The beer is a pure opaque black with no light coming through. Topped with a creamy finger thick head with OK retention. This is a real imperial looking stout. 
 
Smell: Creamy aroma of mocha and fresh espresso. Deep chocolate notes throughout. Not as much bourbon as in the original variant on first glance, which may be a good thing. This is inviting. Dark fruits somewhere within. As the beer warms, more of the bourbon and woody noes come out a bit. Vanilla makes an appearance as well as this warms, and a slight spice. 
 
Taste: Chocolatey up front with notes of mocha in between roasted and toasted malt. Some vanilla quickly covered up by bourbon, which is immediately more evident than in the aroma. Brown sugar, creme caramel. Surprising that this beer retains a sweeter than expected character throughout. Finishes with just as touch of bourbon underneath a really smooth, almost fruity and spicy coffee note. Again not as heavy handed with the bourbon, which is definitely there, but much more nuanced. 
 
Feel: Creamy with light carbonation. Coating. Finishes smooth with just a hint of tingling alcohol at the very end. 
 
Overall: Oh yeah, this is a good one. I love that it doesn't try to hammer you over the head with the bourbon flavor. Instead it slowly brings you in with a wide variety of flavors. The spotlight here is the Turihamwe coffee blend, which really makes a difference in the flavor profile that shows in the end product. A premium product for sure, but it lives up to expectations, revealing something new at every sip. A special experience that will probably show up in my top 10.",4.84

Now this is a special one, the highest rated English Barleywine on BA, VSOJ! A long time want of mine, I wanted to try it while I have the Double Barrel VSOJ on the way thanks to Tavour. I’ve had the OG Straight Jacket and some variants before, but this is by far the most exciting. Let’s get into it 
 
Pours an opaque dark brown with 2 fingers of tan head that slowly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing 
 
The nose brings an intense wave of sweetness, but it’s balanced out by spicier notes. I’m picking up on aromas of burnt caramel, sweet whiskey, molasses, rye bread, golden raisin, brown sugar, charred oak, old leather, fig, tobacco, and sweet toffee 
 
Wow, everything in taste is kicked up a notch, boozy and fruity but not overly sweet. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting fig, sweet toffee, burnt caramel, black cherry, molasses, dry oak, vanilla, earthy whiskey, and light brown sugar. The swallow brings notes of sweet whiskey, charred oak, molasses, rye bread, tobacco, raisin, brown sugar, burnt caramel, vanilla, old leather, and light toffee 
 
A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes a tad sticky and boozy, yet still drinks well below the listed 15%

And what magnificent aromas greet you - rich English toffee, vanilla, a bit of fig, oak, and a smidge of booze, all in perfect balance. I am literally drooling. 
 
The toffee is forward on the taste as expected, but it willingly allows room for the vanilla (hurray!), oak (double hurray!), and especially the fig (cubed hurray!) that provides balance to the sweetness of the other components and coasts into the boozy warming at the back of the palate. Simply stunning flavor profile and nuance to a beer this big (13.8% ABV).

Clover,"Batch 3 bottle poured onsite at Hill Farmstead Brewery in Greensboro Bend, VT. 
 
This one pours a clear golden yellow-ish orange, with a small head, and lots of lacing. 
 
This smells like a sort of rustic oak thing, lemon peel, stone fruit, white wine, candied orange, and a dry hay like quality. 
 
This is a blend of Flora, Art, and Ann, so it’s not surprising at all that this is really good. Having had all of those at this point, I wouldn’t say any one beer entirely stands out – this becomes its own thing that stands completely on its own, and might be better than each of the three titans that contributed. It’s very oaky, and orange-like, with a hay-like dry finish that is just so refreshing. There’s also stone fruit, white wine, dried lemon peel, with a restrained and very pleasant acidity. 
 
This is light bodied, clean, lightly and pleasantly tart, and super drinkable. 
 
This is absolutely fantastic, and might just crack the top 5 of Hill Farmstead beers that I’ve had – it’s just such a good and clearly deliberate blend.",4.96

Clover,"Bottle. 2020 edition. At HF brewery. 
 
White head with some lace. Clear golden color.  
 
Such an excellent saison. Definitely has flavors of the base beers. Elegant is a great word for this beer. Drinks like a white wine maybe a Chardonnay. White grapes, oak, green apples, faint saison spice, wheat. Dry and bubbly. Smooth, light, easy drinking. Faint tartness, nice citrus.",4.7

Clover,"Had b2 and b3 side by side. This rating is for b2, which was better in just about every category than b3. B3 wasnt bad by any means, but b2 was an amazing farmhouse ale /saison",4.71
Clover,"Clear yellow-gold with minimal head formation dying to a clear, bubbly and uneven surface that disperses to a bubbly flat collar. The appearance was impressively identical between two different batches, which we were fortunate enough to enjoy in one evening. 
 
Starting with batch 2, the oak is very expressive, yet gentle at the same time, backed by reduced citrus juice characteristics like grapefruit, orange and lemon. This was a smaller pour than I had of batch 3, but the contrasts were stark, while the more obscure parallels somehow held firm. 
 
Out of batch 3, I perceive a larger presence of straw and young oak up front, but this quickly gives way to more acid than b2, while yet remaining palatably balanced. This acidity expresses like yellow raspberry and seedy passion fruit, countered by a frothy body that exhales refined oak threads. While that Ann oak in conjunction with the subtle funk of Art solidly affirm their support, it was clear that Flora's return to the blend saw her influence well exerted here. 
 
This has been a very long time coming for me, and contrary to most experiences with meeting your idols, this did not let me down. I came away preferring b3, though absent of overwhelming confidence, as they were both phenomenal in different ways.",4.74

Very Hazy,"Pours like opaque guava juice with a 2 finger creamy off-white head that faded extremely slowly and left really nice lacing on the glass. It smells like tangerine, orange juice, papaya, tropical fruit, dank citrus hops, faint biscuit, a hint of caramel and some flowery spices as it fades. The flavor was very similar to the nose with tangerine, orange juice, papaya, tropical fruit, and the additions of peaches, lemon zest and citrus hops that have off the dry hopped vibe. More malty backbone in the taste with sweet grains, biscuit, chalky yeast, graham cracker and then spices like coriander or white pepper in the finish. The bitterness level was perfect and the taste completely hid the ABV, this indeed was very hazy and very tasty overall.",4.34

S: Citrus & tropical fruits, nose could've been better. Nice head retention & lacing 
 
T: Grapefruit, Kiwi Fruit, grassiness, pineapple & dryness up front. Lime, peaches, oranges & pineapple as this beer warms up, acidic notes from the pineapple, some grassy notes as well. Finishes with pineapple & orange, plus limes  
 
MF: Medium body, fairly restrained carbonation, carbonation goes creamy as this warms up; nice balance 
 
Very nice take on the style just got better as this warmed up. If everything else was equal to the flavor, I would rated this higher",4.47

Look - No head and little carb, gold color.

Feel - Medium mouthfeel with low carbonation.  
Overall - Just too sour and acidly of a lambic for me to really enjoy; I need to give another blend another shot just to see if it was this batch, or if Zenne might not be my thing.",4.31

Pliny The Younger,"I've been chasing this beer for the better part of 13 years. Today was finally the day. 500ml capped bottle into a Fuzzy IPA glass.  
 
Pours crystal clear goldenrod with a slowly building 2 finger foamy white head that sits around. Patchy, stringy lace sticks to the inside of the glass. Nose is citrus, pine, grass, and sap. Fresh, aggressive, resiny. Very pungent. Beer opens grass, pine, and citrus. Zesty towards the middle with loads of fresh pine, unripened tropical fruit, and tree sap. Finishes with a crystal clean bitterness that is dry and lingers in the aftertaste. Body is light to medium with ample carbonation. Prickly and lively on the palate, and goes down dry with a lingering, sticky aftertaste.  
 
I may be buying into the hype a bit after all this time but in a category that everyone in the world tries to do 10 times over, this is somehow the best of the bunch. A near perfect beer in every way. This juice is worth the squeeze.",4.86

Zenne Y Frontera,"A: Pours crystal clear, dark golden yellow, almost amber, small fizzy white head that dissipates quickly. 4.25 
 
S: Aroma is tart lactic acidity, a big minerality, some plastic like funk notes, only the faintest barnyard characters. Mild sherry notes give it a subtle fruitiness. A bit of spice on the finish like white pepper. 4.75 
 
T: Taste is immediately wildly complex. There’s a sweetness up front followed by a sour tart punch, then lingering oaky vanilla on the finish that lasts forever. It’s not as aggressively tart as some lambics/gueuzes, likely subdued by the cask asking. Other characters I get are red grapes, tart citrus, moderate spice. Just fantastic, so much going on, and the finish is divine. 5 
 
M/D: Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Carbonation lower than most in the style but insanely drinkable. 4.25

King JJJuliusss,"Poured from a can into a snifter 
Appearance- The beer pours a super hazy orange-juice color with a massive puffy white head. The head has a great level of retention, fading slowly over time and leaving spiderweb lacing all over the sides of the glass. 
Smell – The aroma is huge of an orange rind smell mixed with sweet notes of tangerine and orange as well as plenty of herbal hops and a strong showing of pine and earth. Mixed with thee smells are some juicy pineapple, mango, and papaya with some citrus hop smell with a ruby red grapefruit. Other citrus notes of lemon and lime as well as some bready malt and light grain are there as well, mixing in with some raw hop smells to produce a rather dank and green hoppy smell overall. m 
Taste – The taste begins with a thick bready malt flavor that is composed mostly of a smooth wheat, doughy, and oaty flavor. There is also a moderately sizable fruit flavor upfront, with orange and peach being the strongest, but with notes of pear and apple and a hint of lemon in there as well. The hop is strong from the start as well, with a earthy and herbal hop being the most pronounced followed by some notes of pine and floral hops. As the taste advances the pine and herb grown stronger while the earth fades, bringing more dankness to the tongue. That said the sweetness picks up a tad, balancing out the hops rather well, and with some very raw hop and grassy flavors coming on at the end, one is left with a dank, but sweeter and malty taste to linger on the tongue. 
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is thick and chewy with a moderate to higher carbonation level. Quite nice for the thick and dank tastes of the brew and certainly makes for a nice slow sipper. 
Overall –A quite nice and tasty brew with a lot of hop attitude, but a balanced demeaner. While not quite up to the hype, it is certainly a well crafted brew.",4.39

Having been blessed with national travel for work and fly fishing trips - and the expendable budget to have had the opportunity to try many of the top beers on beer advocate and those celebrated by fellow beer lovers. I’ve had many many IPAs from Vermont to Colorado and New York to California - but my brother and his gang of beer connoisseurs demanded that I join them in Boulder Colorado for the tapping of a 2023 Pliny the Younger at the annual celebration at Backcountry Pizza & Taphouse… and I couldn’t be more delighted that they did - might be best beer that have ever crossed this unrefined pallet.
